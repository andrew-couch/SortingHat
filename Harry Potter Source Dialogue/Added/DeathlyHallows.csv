"YAXLEY","...will not be moved"
"YAXLEY","until the 30th of this month."
"YAXLEY","The day before he turns 17."
"YAXLEY","This is a false trail."
"YAXLEY","The Auror Office no longer plays any part"

"YAXLEY","- Where will he be taken, the boy?"
"YAXLEY","Most likely the home of someone"

"YAXLEY","I'm told it's been given"

"YAXLEY","That my wand and Potter's"

"YAXLEY","They are, in some ways, twins."
"YAXLEY","We can wound,"

"HARRY","...coming out of it."
"HARRY","- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?"
"HARRY","- My name."
"HARRY","Just my name."
"HARRY","Like a whisper."

"HARRY","And I knew."
"HARRY","And sure enough, it floated toward me,"
"HARRY","the ball of light..."
"HARRY","...went right to my chest,"
"HARRY","straight through me. Right here."
"HARRY","And I knew it was gonna take me"
"HARRY","where I needed to go, so I Disapparated..."

"HARRY","It was dark. I had no idea where I was."
"HARRY","I just hoped"

"HARRY","Well, just keep talking about that"
"HARRY","little ball of light touching your heart..."
"HARRY","...and she'll come round."
"HARRY","It was true. Every word."
"HARRY","This is gonna sound crazy..."
"HARRY","...but I think that's why Dumbledore"
"HARRY","left it to me, the Deluminator."
"HARRY","I think he knew that somehow I'd need it"
"HARRY","to find my way back, and she'd lead me."
"HARRY","Bloody hell, I just realized,"
"HARRY","you need a wand, don't you?"
"HARRY","- Yeah."
"HARRY","- I've got one here."
"HARRY","It's a blackthorn. Ten inches."
"HARRY","Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do."
"HARRY","Took if off a Snatcher"
"HARRY","a couple of weeks ago."
"HARRY","Don't tell Hermione this,"
"HARRY","but they're a bit dim, Snatchers."
"HARRY","This one was definitely part troll,"
"HARRY","the smell of him."
"HARRY","Engorgio."
"HARRY","- Reducio!"
"HARRY","- Nothing."
"HARRY","- Nothing."
"HARRY","We need to talk."
"HARRY","Yeah, all right."
"HARRY","- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood."
"HARRY","- Sorry?"
"HARRY","See this?"
"HARRY","It's a letter Dumbledore wrote"
"HARRY","to Grindelwald. Look at the signature."
"HARRY","It's the mark again."
"HARRY","It keeps cropping up."
"HARRY","In Beedle the Bard,"
"HARRY","in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow."
"HARRY","It was there too."
"HARRY","- Where?"
"HARRY","But what does it mean?"
"HARRY","Look, you've got no idea where"
"HARRY","the next Horcrux is, and neither do I..."
"HARRY","...but this, this means something."
"HARRY","- I'm sure of it."
"HARRY","- Yeah. Hermione's right."
"HARRY","We ought to see Lovegood."
"HARRY","Let's vote on it. Those in favor?"

"HERMIONE & HARRY","Could we come in?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","- Luna?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","She'll be along."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","Well, actually...."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","It was about something you were wearing"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","round your neck at the wedding. A symbol."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","You mean this?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","Yes."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","That exactly."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","What we've wondered is, what is it?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","What is it?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows,"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","of course."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","- The what?"
"HERMIONE & HARRY","The Deathly Hallows."
"HERMIONE & HARRY","I assume you're all familiar with"

"RON","No. It's fine."
"HERMIONE","""There were once three brothers..."
"HERMIONE","...who were traveling along a lonely,"
"HERMIONE","winding road at twilight."
"HERMIONE","In time, the brothers reached a river"
"HERMIONE","too treacherous to pass."
"HERMIONE","But being learned in the magical arts..."
"HERMIONE","...the three brothers simply"
"HERMIONE","waved their wands and made a bridge."
"HERMIONE","Before they could cross, however..."
"HERMIONE","...they found their path blocked"
"HERMIONE","by a hooded figure."
"HERMIONE","It was Death, and he felt cheated."
"HERMIONE","Cheated because travelers would"
"HERMIONE","normally drown in the river."
"HERMIONE","But Death was cunning."
"HERMIONE","He pretended to congratulate"
"HERMIONE","the three brothers on their magic..."
"HERMIONE","...and said that each had earned a prize for"
"HERMIONE","having been clever enough to evade him."
"HERMIONE","The oldest asked for a wand"
"HERMIONE","more powerful than any in existence."
"HERMIONE","So Death fashioned him one"
"HERMIONE","from an elder tree that stood nearby."
"HERMIONE","The second brother decided he wanted"
"HERMIONE","to humiliate Death even further..."
"HERMIONE","...and asked for the power"
"HERMIONE","to recall loved ones from the grave."
"HERMIONE","So Death plucked a stone from the river"
"HERMIONE","and offered it to him."
"HERMIONE","Finally,"
"HERMIONE","Death turned to the third brother."
"HERMIONE","A humble man..."
"HERMIONE","...he asked for something that would"
"HERMIONE","allow him to go forth from that place..."
"HERMIONE","...without being followed by Death."
"HERMIONE","And so it was that Death reluctantly"
"HERMIONE","handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility."
"HERMIONE","The first brother traveled"
"HERMIONE","to a distant village..."
"HERMIONE","...where, with the Elder Wand in hand..."
"HERMIONE","...he killed a wizard"
"HERMIONE","with whom he had once quarreled."
"HERMIONE","Drunk with the power"
"HERMIONE","that the Elder Wand had given him..."
"HERMIONE","...he bragged of his invincibility."
"HERMIONE","But that night,"
"HERMIONE","another wizard stole the wand..."
"HERMIONE","...and slit the brother's throat"
"HERMIONE","for good measure."
"HERMIONE","And so Death took the first brother"
"HERMIONE","for his own."
"HERMIONE","The second brother journeyed"
"HERMIONE","to his home..."
"HERMIONE","...where he took the stone"
"HERMIONE","and turned it thrice in hand."
"HERMIONE","To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped"
"HERMIONE","to marry before her untimely death..."
"HERMIONE","...appeared before him."
"HERMIONE","Yet, soon she turned sad and cold"
"HERMIONE","for she did not belong in the mortal world."
"HERMIONE","Driven mad with hopeless longing..."
"HERMIONE","...the second brother killed himself"
"HERMIONE","so as to join her."
"HERMIONE","And so Death took the second brother."
"HERMIONE","As for the third brother..."
"HERMIONE","...Death searched for many years"
"HERMIONE","but was never able to find him."
"HERMIONE","Only when he attained a great age"
"HERMIONE","did the youngest brother..."
"HERMIONE","...shed the Cloak of Invisibility"
"HERMIONE","and give it to his son."
"HERMIONE","He then greeted Death as an old friend"
"HERMIONE","and went with him gladly..."
"HERMIONE","...departing this life as equals."""
