Gryffindor,Black,you did back there.
Gryffindor,Black,He doesn't deserve it.
Gryffindor,Black,I didn't think my dad
Gryffindor,Black,would have wanted his best friends...

Gryffindor,Black,"Besides, dead,"
Gryffindor,Black,the truth dies with him.
Gryffindor,Black,"Alive, you're free."
Gryffindor,Black,Anything but the dementors!
Gryffindor,Black,Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
Gryffindor,Black,You won't let them give me...

Gryffindor,Black,"...but when you were born, James"
Gryffindor,Black,and Lily made me your godfather.
Gryffindor,Black,I know.
Gryffindor,Black,I can understand if you choose

Gryffindor,Black,And you know it.
Gryffindor,Black,"And for now, that will do."

Gryffindor,Black,...but you look so like your father.
Gryffindor,Black,Except your eyes.
Gryffindor,Black,-You have--
Gryffindor,Black,-My mother's eyes.
Gryffindor,Black,It's cruel that I spent so much time
Gryffindor,Black,"with James and Lily, and you so little."

Slytherin,Crabbe,"Bloody hell, Harry."
Slytherin,Crabbe,That was not funny.
Slytherin,Crabbe,Those weasels! Never told me

Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Finally, on a more disquieting note..."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...at the request
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,of the Ministry of Magic...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"...Hogwarts will, until further notice,"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...until such a time
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,as Sirius Black is captured.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,The dementors will be stationed
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,at every entrance to the grounds.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Now whilst l've been assured...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...that their presence will not disrupt
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,our day-to-day activities...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...a word of caution.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Dementors are vicious creatures.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,They'll not distinguish...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...between the one they hunt
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,and the one who gets in their way.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Therefore, I must warn"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,each and every one of you...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...to give them no reason
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,to harm you.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,It is not in the nature
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,of a dementor to be forgiving.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"But you know,"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,happiness can be found...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...even in the darkest of times...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...if one only remembers
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,to turn on the light.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Tell them to search every painting
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"There's no need for ghosts, professor."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,The Fat Lady's there.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,I didn't really expect him to linger.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"For in dreams, we enter a world"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,that's entirely our own.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Let them swim in the deepest ocean
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,or glide over the highest cloud.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Turn to page 394.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Excuse me, sir."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Where's Professor Lupin?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"That's not really your concern,"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"is it, Potter?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Suffice it to say your professor
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,finds himself incapable of teaching...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...at the present time.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Turn to page 394.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Werewolves?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Sir, we just learned about red caps"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,and hinkypunks.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,-We're not meant to start that for weeks.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,When did she come in?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Did you see her come in?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,can tell me the difference...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...between an Animagus
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,and a werewolf?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,No one?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,An Animagus is a wizard
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,who elects to turn into an animal.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,A werewolf has no choice.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,With each full moon...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...he no longer remembers who he is.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,He'd kill his best friend.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,The werewolf only responds
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,to the call of its own kind.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,That's the second time...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"...you've spoken out of turn,"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Miss Granger.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Are you incapable
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,of restraining yourself...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...or do you take pride in being
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,an insufferable know-it-all?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"-He's got a point, you know."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"As an antidote to your ignorance,"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"and on my desk, by Monday morning..."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...two rolls of parchment
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"on the werewolf, with emphasis..."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,-...on recognizing it.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,-lt's Quidditch tomorrow.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Then l suggest you take extra care,"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Mr. Potter.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Page 394.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"The term ""werewolf""..."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...is a contraction
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"of the Anglo-Saxon word ""wer""..."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"...which means ""man,"" and ""wolf."""
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Werewolf, man-wolf."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,There are several ways
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,to become a werewolf.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,They include being given the power
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,of shape-shifting...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...being bitten by a werewolf....
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Aresto momentum!
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,What do you expect?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,He fell over 1 00 feet.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,and see what you look like.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,than he normally does.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"No, minister. Over this way."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,It's late. It's nearly dark.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,You shouldn't be here.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Someone sees you outside
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"this time of night, you'll be in trouble."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"Particularly you, Harry."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,With you in a moment!
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Quick. Quick!
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Hagrid.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,-lt'll be fine. It'll be okay.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"-Go on, go on!"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,That's ling you see there--
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"get down to our business, shall we?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,Very well. It is the decision
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,of the Committee for the Disposal...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,...of Dangerous Creatures
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,"...hereinafter called ""the condemned,"""
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,shall be executed this day at sundown.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,All right. lt'll be all right.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore,I thought I just saw--

Gryffindor,Dumbledore, All right.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, How extraordinary.

Gryffindor,Fred,We'll get you there.
Gryffindor,Fred,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Fred,-What are you doing?!
Gryffindor,Fred,-What's this rubbish?
Gryffindor,Fred,"-""What's this rubbish?"" he says."
Gryffindor,Fred,-lt's the secret to our success.
Gryffindor,Fred,-lt's a wrench giving it to you--
Gryffindor,Fred,But we've decided
Gryffindor,Fred,your needs are greater than ours.
Gryffindor,Fred,"George, if you will."
Gryffindor,Fred,I solemnly swear
Gryffindor,Fred,that I am up to no good.

Hufflepuff,Fudge,I broke the law. Underage wizards
Hufflepuff,Fudge,can't use magic at home.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Come now. The Ministry
Hufflepuff,Fudge,doesn't send people to Azkaban...
Hufflepuff,Fudge,...for blowing up their aunts.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"On the other hand, running away"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"like that, given the state of things..."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"...was very, very irresponsible."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"-""The state of things,"" sir?"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,#NAME?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Sirius Black, you mean?"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,But what's he got to do with me?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Nothing, of course. You're safe."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,And that's what matters.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,And tomorrow you'll be
Hufflepuff,Fudge,on your way back to Hogwarts.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,These are your new schoolbooks.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,I took the liberty...
Hufflepuff,Fudge,...of having them brought here.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Hedwig.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"here, it would be best if you didn't..."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,...wander.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,that bus or what?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Come with us now. Come on.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Buckbeak. Okay?

Hufflepuff,Fudge,Buckbeak.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Someone's obviously released him.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,#NAME?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,#NAME?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,you had anything to do with this.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,How could you?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,You've been with us all the time.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,#NAME?
Hufflepuff,Fudge,We must search the grounds.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Well, search the skies,"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"if you must, minister."
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,of tea or a large brandy.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"Oh, executioner, your services"
Hufflepuff,Fudge,are no longer required.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,Thank you.
Hufflepuff,Fudge,"in this house, professor."
Hufflepuff,Fudge," As Minister for Magic,"
Hufflepuff,Fudge, McGonagall!
Hufflepuff,Fudge," Oh, Hagrid...."

Hufflepuff,Fudge, The execution shall dispatch--
Hufflepuff,Fudge, Your name only.

Hufflepuff,Fudge," Let's get this over, please."
Hufflepuff,Fudge," Come now, Dumbledore."
Gryffindor,George,You gave us a right good scare.
Gryffindor,George,Really? l meant the match. Who won?
Gryffindor,George,"Um, no one blames you, Harry."
Gryffindor,George,Dementors aren't supposed to be
Gryffindor,George,on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
Gryffindor,George,"After he saved you,"
Gryffindor,George,he sent them off.
Gryffindor,George,There's something else
Gryffindor,George,you should know too.
Gryffindor,George,"When you fell, your broom sort of blew"
Gryffindor,George,"into the Whomping Willow, and...."
Gryffindor,George,Well....
Gryffindor,George,about your broomstick.
Gryffindor,George,Is there no chance of fixing it?
Gryffindor,George,Does that a lot.

Gryffindor,Hagrid,You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

Gryffindor,Hagrid,"Oh, crikey."
Gryffindor,Hagrid,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Gryffindor,Hagrid,"Oh, no."
Gryffindor,Hagrid,He bit me. Scabbers.
Gryffindor,Hagrid,Ron. Ron!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Nice and slow, now."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, He may let you ride him now.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Put you over here,"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well done, Harry,"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, No!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Sorry.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," No, l'm not sacked."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore.
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Make your way through.
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Gentlemen.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Dear, dear...."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Keep a closer eye on your pet.
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Right.
Gryffindor,Hagrid, You'll find no small glasses
Gryffindor,Harry,Lumos Maxima.
Gryffindor,Harry,Lumos Maxima.
Gryffindor,Harry,Lumos Maxima!
Gryffindor,Harry,I didn't mean to blow her up. l just--
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
Gryffindor,Harry,I was lucky not to be arrested.
Gryffindor,Harry,Whoa!
Gryffindor,Harry,Ha! Whoo-hoo!
Gryffindor,Harry,AND CLAPPlNG]
Gryffindor,Harry,"and well done, Buckbeak."
Gryffindor,Harry,I did think of Voldemort at first.
Gryffindor,Harry,But then l remembered that night
Gryffindor,Harry,on the train...
Gryffindor,Harry,-...and the dementor.
Gryffindor,Harry,-l'm very impressed.
Gryffindor,Harry,That suggests what you fear the most
Gryffindor,Harry,is fear itself.
Gryffindor,Harry,This is very wise.
Gryffindor,Harry,Before I fainted...
Gryffindor,Harry,...l heard something.
Gryffindor,Harry,A woman...
Gryffindor,Harry,...screaming.
Gryffindor,Harry,Dementors force us to relive
Gryffindor,Harry,our very worst memories.
Gryffindor,Harry,Our pain becomes their power.
Gryffindor,Harry,I think it was my mother...
Gryffindor,Harry,...the night she was murdered.
Gryffindor,Harry,"The very first time l saw you, Harry,"
Gryffindor,Harry,I recognized you immediately.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Not by your scar, by your eyes."
Gryffindor,Harry,"They're your mother, Lily's."
Gryffindor,Harry,Yes.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Oh, yes. I knew her."
Gryffindor,Harry,Your mother was there for me
Gryffindor,Harry,at a time when no one else was.
Gryffindor,Harry,Not only was she
Gryffindor,Harry,a singularly gifted witch...
Gryffindor,Harry,...she was also
Gryffindor,Harry,an uncommonly kind woman.
Gryffindor,Harry,She had a way of seeing
Gryffindor,Harry,the beauty in others...
Gryffindor,Harry,"...even, and most especially, when that"
Gryffindor,Harry,person could not see it in themselves.
Gryffindor,Harry,"And your father, James,"
Gryffindor,Harry,on the other hand...
Gryffindor,Harry,...he....
Gryffindor,Harry,"He had a certain, shall we say,"
Gryffindor,Harry,talent for trouble.
Gryffindor,Harry,"A talent, rumor has it,"
Gryffindor,Harry,he passed on to you.
Gryffindor,Harry,You're more like them
Gryffindor,Harry,"than you know, Harry."
Gryffindor,Harry,"In time, you'll come to see"
Gryffindor,Harry,just how much.
Gryffindor,Harry,but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
Gryffindor,Harry,We never got to go
Gryffindor,Harry,to the Shrieking Shack.
Gryffindor,Harry,-You heard it's the most--
Gryffindor,Harry,What's going on?
Gryffindor,Harry,the password again.
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
Gryffindor,Harry,"Get back, all of you."
Gryffindor,Harry,No one is to enter this dormitory
Gryffindor,Harry,until it's been searched.
Gryffindor,Harry,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Gryffindor,Harry,She was a terrible singer.
Gryffindor,Harry,No.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Professor, why do the dementors"
Gryffindor,Harry,affect me so?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Dementors are the foulest creatures
Gryffindor,Harry,to walk this earth.
Gryffindor,Harry,"They feed on every good feeling,"
Gryffindor,Harry,every happy memory...
Gryffindor,Harry,...until a person is left with absolutely
Gryffindor,Harry,nothing but his worst experiences.
Gryffindor,Harry,"You are not weak, Harry."
Gryffindor,Harry,Dementors affect you most because
Gryffindor,Harry,there are true horrors in your past.
Gryffindor,Harry,Horrors your classmates
Gryffindor,Harry,can scarcely imagine.
Gryffindor,Harry,You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Gryffindor,Harry,"-l'm scared, professor."
Gryffindor,Harry,-l'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
Gryffindor,Harry,I need to know how to fight them.
Gryffindor,Harry,You could teach me.
Gryffindor,Harry,You made the one
Gryffindor,Harry,on the train go away.
Gryffindor,Harry,There was only one that night.
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,"-l don't pretend to be an expert, Harry."
Gryffindor,Harry,But as the dementors seem
Gryffindor,Harry,to have developed an interest in you...
Gryffindor,Harry,...perhaps I should teach you.
Gryffindor,Harry,But after the holidays.
Gryffindor,Harry,"For now, I need to rest."
Gryffindor,Harry,"Come on, now!"
Gryffindor,Harry,So this map shows--
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?

Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
Gryffindor,Harry,"And don't forget. When you're done,"
Gryffindor,Harry,I'm sure.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Well, everything's prepared."
Gryffindor,Harry,The spell l'm going to teach you
Gryffindor,Harry,is called the Patronus Charm.
Gryffindor,Harry,Did you ever hear of it?
Gryffindor,Harry,No? Well....
Gryffindor,Harry,A Patronus is a positive force.
Gryffindor,Harry,For the wizard who conjures one...
Gryffindor,Harry,"...it works like a shield, with the"
Gryffindor,Harry,dementor feeding on it rather than him.
Gryffindor,Harry,"But in order for it to work,"
Gryffindor,Harry,you need to think of a memory.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Not just any memory, a very happy"
Gryffindor,Harry,"memory, a very powerful memory."
Gryffindor,Harry,Can you do this?
Gryffindor,Harry,Yes. Very well.
Gryffindor,Harry,Close your eyes.
Gryffindor,Harry,Concentrate.
Gryffindor,Harry,Explore your past.
Gryffindor,Harry,Do you have a memory?
Gryffindor,Harry,Allow it to fill you up.
Gryffindor,Harry,Lose yourself within it.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Then speak the incantation,"
Gryffindor,Harry,Expecto Patronum.
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Gryffindor,Harry,Expecto Patronum!
Gryffindor,Harry,Expecto.... Expecto....
Gryffindor,Harry,Expect....
Gryffindor,Harry,Sit up. Deep breaths.
Gryffindor,Harry,It's all right. l didn't expect you
Gryffindor,Harry,to do it the first time.
Gryffindor,Harry,That would have been remarkable.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
Gryffindor,Harry,-That's one nasty dementor.
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,"That was a boggart, Harry."
Gryffindor,Harry,A boggart.
Gryffindor,Harry,The real thing would be worse.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Much, much worse."
Gryffindor,Harry,"As a matter of interest,"
Gryffindor,Harry,what were you thinking?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,That's not good enough.
Gryffindor,Harry,Not nearly good enough.
Gryffindor,Harry,There's another.
Gryffindor,Harry,"It's not happy, exactly."
Gryffindor,Harry,"Well, it is."
Gryffindor,Harry,It's the happiest I've ever felt...
Gryffindor,Harry,-...but it's complicated.
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Gryffindor,Harry,Just do it.
Gryffindor,Harry,Expecto Patronum!
Gryffindor,Harry,Wait!
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
Gryffindor,Harry,"Harry, Hermione, run!"
Gryffindor,Harry,Come on!

Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,It's a trap. He's the dog.
Gryffindor,Harry,He's an Animagus.
Gryffindor,Harry,"If you want to kill Harry,"
Gryffindor,Harry,you have to kill us too!
Gryffindor,Harry,No. Only one will die tonight.
Gryffindor,Harry,Then it'll be you!
Gryffindor,Harry,"Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Harry,-Expelliarmus!
Gryffindor,Harry,"Well, well, Sirius."
Gryffindor,Harry,"Looking rather ragged, aren't we?"
Gryffindor,Harry,"Finally, the flesh"
Gryffindor,Harry,reflects the madness within.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Well, you'd know all about"
Gryffindor,Harry,"the madness within, wouldn't you?"
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,-lt's him.
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,-Let's kill him!
Gryffindor,Harry,-No! I trusted you!
Gryffindor,Harry,"And all this time,"
Gryffindor,Harry,you've been his friend.
Gryffindor,Harry,He's a werewolf!
Gryffindor,Harry,That's why he's been missing classes.
Gryffindor,Harry,How long have you known?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,You are the brightest witch
Gryffindor,Harry,of your age l've ever met.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Enough talk, Remus!"
Gryffindor,Harry,"Come on, let's kill him!"
Gryffindor,Harry,-Wait!
Gryffindor,Harry,-l did my waiting!
Gryffindor,Harry,Twelve years of it!
Gryffindor,Harry,In Azkaban!
Gryffindor,Harry,I know why.
Gryffindor,Harry,You betrayed my parents.
Gryffindor,Harry,-You're the reason they're dead!
Gryffindor,Harry,"-No, it wasn't him."
Gryffindor,Harry,Somebody did betray your parents...
Gryffindor,Harry,"...somebody who, until quite recently,"
Gryffindor,Harry,I believed to be dead!
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,-Peter Pettigrew!
Gryffindor,Harry,And he's in this room! Right now!
Gryffindor,Harry,"Come out, come out, Peter!"
Gryffindor,Harry,"-Come out, come out and play!"
Gryffindor,Harry,-Expelliarmus!
Gryffindor,Harry,Vengeance is sweet.
Gryffindor,Harry,How I hoped l'd be the one
Gryffindor,Harry,to catch you.
Gryffindor,Harry,Expelliarmus!
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,-You attacked a teacher!
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,We thought he was our friend!
Gryffindor,Harry,-No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
Gryffindor,Harry,"-No, he didn't."
Gryffindor,Harry,"I thought so too, until you mentioned"
Gryffindor,Harry,Pettigrew on the map!
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,-The map never lies!
Gryffindor,Harry,Pettigrew's alive!
Gryffindor,Harry,And he's right there!
Gryffindor,Harry,-Me?! He's mental!
Gryffindor,Harry,-Not you! Your rat!
Gryffindor,Harry,-Scabbers has been in my family for--
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Curiously long life
Gryffindor,Harry,for a common garden rat!
Gryffindor,Harry,"-He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
Gryffindor,Harry,-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
Gryffindor,Harry,Dirty coward cut it off
Gryffindor,Harry,so everyone would think he was dead!
Gryffindor,Harry,-And then he transformed into a rat!
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,Scabbers!
Gryffindor,Harry,Leave him alone! Get off him!
Gryffindor,Harry,What are you doing?
Gryffindor,Harry,Ah!
Gryffindor,Harry,Remus?
Gryffindor,Harry,Sirius.
Gryffindor,Harry,My old friends!
Gryffindor,Harry,Harry! Look at you.
Gryffindor,Harry,You look so much like your father.
Gryffindor,Harry,-James. We were the best of friends--
Gryffindor,Harry,-How dare you speak to Harry!
Gryffindor,Harry,How dare you talk about James
Gryffindor,Harry,in front of him!
Gryffindor,Harry,-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
Gryffindor,Harry,-l didn't mean to!
Gryffindor,Harry,The Dark Lord. You have no idea
Gryffindor,Harry,the weapons he possesses!
Gryffindor,Harry,"Ask yourself, Sirius!"
Gryffindor,Harry,What would you have done?
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,"-Died, rather than betray my friends!"
Gryffindor,Harry,wanted me killed!
Gryffindor,Harry,Your dad would have spared me!
Gryffindor,Harry,He would have shown me mercy!
Gryffindor,Harry,"didn't kill you, we would. Together!"
Gryffindor,Harry,No!
Gryffindor,Harry,"-Harry, this man--"
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,But we'll take him to the castle.
Gryffindor,Harry,"-Bless you, boy. Bless you!"
Gryffindor,Harry,-Get off!
Gryffindor,Harry,I said we'd take you to the castle.
Gryffindor,Harry,"After that,"
Gryffindor,Harry,the dementors can have you.
Gryffindor,Harry,I reckon that twinges a bit.
Gryffindor,Harry,You almost tore my leg off!
Gryffindor,Harry,Okay.
Gryffindor,Harry,Okay.
Gryffindor,Harry,It's fine. I'll stay.
Gryffindor,Harry,"You go, l'll stay."
Gryffindor,Harry,-l'm fine. Go.

Gryffindor,Harry,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

Gryffindor,Harry,Of course.
Gryffindor,Harry,Remember what Dumbledore said?
Gryffindor,Harry,"If we succeed, more than one"
Gryffindor,Harry,innocent life could be spared.
Gryffindor,Harry,Let's go.
Gryffindor,Harry,Here they come. l'd better hurry.
Gryffindor,Harry,Fudge has to see Buckbeak
Gryffindor,Harry,before we steal him.
Gryffindor,Harry,"Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid"
Gryffindor,Harry,set him free.
Gryffindor,Harry,What?
Gryffindor,Harry,Get away. Get off.

Gryffindor,Harry,With a Patronus.
Gryffindor,Harry,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
Gryffindor,Harry,According to him...
Gryffindor,Harry,...only a really powerful wizard
Gryffindor,Harry,could have conjured it.
Gryffindor,Harry,It was my dad.
Gryffindor,Harry,My dad conjured the Patronus.
Gryffindor,Harry,"-Harry, but your dad's--"
Gryffindor,Harry,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Harry,I'm just telling you what l saw.
Gryffindor,Harry,Here we come.
Gryffindor,Harry,-That's great.

Gryffindor,Harry,He'll like that after
Gryffindor,Harry,all those years in Azkaban.
Gryffindor,Harry,Thanks.
Gryffindor,Harry,-Great. Now he's coming for us.
Gryffindor,Harry,"-Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"

Gryffindor,Hermlone,Harry.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Harry, are you all right?"
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Thank you.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,A fair few.

Gryffindor,Hermlone,"That was wicked, Harry!"
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Oh, please."
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Dufftown? That's not far from here.

Gryffindor,Hermlone,"to Hogwarts, do you?"

Gryffindor,Hermlone,He slipped past them once.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Who's to say he won't do it again?
Gryffindor,Hermlone,That's right. Black could be anywhere.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,It's like trying to catch smoke.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Like trying to catch smoke
Gryffindor,Hermlone,with your bare hands.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"It's not funny, Ron."

Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents"
Gryffindor,Hermlone,realized they were marked for death--
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Remember? They hid.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Few knew where they were.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,One who did was Sirius Black.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,And he told You-Know-Who.

Gryffindor,Hermlone,Black was vicious.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,He didn't kill Pettigrew.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,He destroyed him!
Gryffindor,Hermlone,A finger. That's all that was left.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,A finger. Nothing else.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Sirius Black may not have
Gryffindor,Hermlone,put his hands to the Potters...
Gryffindor,Hermlone,-...but he's the reason they're dead.

Gryffindor,Hermlone,I hope he finds me.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Because when he does,"
Gryffindor,Hermlone,I'm gonna be ready!
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"When he does, l'm gonna kill him!"
Gryffindor,Hermlone,And then?
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"And then he asked for the worst,"
Gryffindor,Hermlone,did old Lucius.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

Gryffindor,Hermlone,He sent the dementors away.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,I saw him across the lake.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Harry, they've captured Sirius."
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Any minute the dementors
Gryffindor,Hermlone,are gonna perform the Kiss.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,-They're gonna kill him?
Gryffindor,Hermlone,-No. It's worse.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Much worse.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,They're going to suck out his soul.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Headmaster, stop them."
Gryffindor,Hermlone,-They've got the wrong man.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,-lt's true. Sirius is innocent.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,-lt's Scabbers who did it.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Hermlone,We're coming out the back door. Go!

Gryffindor,Hermlone,He'll conjure the Patronus.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Any minute now.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Right there. You'll see.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Harry, listen to me."
Gryffindor,Hermlone,No one's coming.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"Don't worry, he will."
Gryffindor,Hermlone,He will come.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,...both of you.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Harry!
Gryffindor,Hermlone,Expecto Patronum!
Gryffindor,Hermlone,"You were right, Hermione."
Gryffindor,Hermlone,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,It was me!
Gryffindor,Hermlone,I saw myself conjuring
Gryffindor,Hermlone,the Patronus before.
Gryffindor,Hermlone,I knew l could do it
Gryffindor,Hermlone,this time because...

Gryffindor,Hermlone," Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
Gryffindor,Hermlone," Honestly, it's not funny."
Gryffindor,Hermlone, That's awful.
Gryffindor,Hermlone," Honestly, Ron. If you ask me,"
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Don't be silly. How could
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Just ignore him.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, No one knows.
Gryffindor,Hermlone," Please, sir."
Gryffindor,Hermlone, lt's meant to be
Gryffindor,Hermlone, He won't keep it.
Gryffindor,Hermlone," Excuse me, excuse me."
Gryffindor,Hermlone," Well, maybe you should"
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Did not.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Didn't.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, l can't believe they're going
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Ron!
Gryffindor,Hermlone," Oh, I'm sorry."
Gryffindor,Hermlone," We're in the Shrieking Shack,"
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Ron. You're okay.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, That looks really painful.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, l'm sure Madam Pomfrey
Gryffindor,Hermlone,7
Gryffindor,Hermlone," You foul, loathsome,"
Gryffindor,Hermlone, That felt good.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Come on.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, Uh-huh.
Gryffindor,Hermlone, You're dying...
No Entry,Just Give It A Tap And Say,Mischief managed.

No Entry,Listen,-Riddikulus!
No Entry,Listen,-Riddikulus!
No Entry,Listen,#NAME?
No Entry,Listen,"So much for the easy part. You see,"
No Entry,Listen,the incantation alone is not enough.
No Entry,Listen,What really finishes a boggart
No Entry,Listen,is laughter.
No Entry,Listen,You need to force it to assume
No Entry,Listen,a shape you find truly amusing.
No Entry,Listen,"Let me explain. Neville,"

Gryffindor,Lupln,"Here, eat this. lt'll help."
Gryffindor,Lupln,It's all right. lt's chocolate.
Gryffindor,Lupln,What was that thing that came?
Gryffindor,Lupln,It was a dementor. One of the guards
Gryffindor,Lupln,of Azkaban. lt's gone now.
Gryffindor,Lupln,It was searching the train
Gryffindor,Lupln,for Sirius Black.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"If you'll excuse me, l need to have"
Gryffindor,Lupln,a little word with the driver.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Eat. You'll feel better.
Gryffindor,Lupln,What happened to me?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Well, you sort of went rigid."
Gryffindor,Lupln,We thought maybe you were
Gryffindor,Lupln,having a fit or something.
Gryffindor,Lupln,And did either of you two...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...you know...
Gryffindor,Lupln,-...pass out?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"I felt weird, though."
Gryffindor,Lupln,Like l'd never be cheerful again.
Gryffindor,Lupln,But someone was screaming.
Gryffindor,Lupln,A woman.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"No one was screaming, Harry."
Gryffindor,Lupln,Welcome! Welcome to another year
Gryffindor,Lupln,at Hogwarts.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Now, l'd like to say a few words..."
Gryffindor,Lupln,...before we all become too befuddled
Gryffindor,Lupln,by our excellent feast.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"First, I'm pleased to welcome"
Gryffindor,Lupln,Professor R.J. Lupin...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...who's kindly consented
Gryffindor,Lupln,to fill the post...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...of Defense Against
Gryffindor,Lupln,the Dark Arts teacher.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Good luck, professor."
Gryffindor,Lupln,Of course. That's why he knew
Gryffindor,Lupln,"to give you the chocolate, Harry."
Gryffindor,Lupln,Potter. Potter. ls it true you fainted?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,Magical Creatures teacher...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...has decided to retire...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...in order to spend more time
Gryffindor,Lupln,with his remaining limbs.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Fortunately,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,I'm delighted to announce...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...that his place will be taken
Gryffindor,Lupln,by none other...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Intriguing, isn't it?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,Would anyone like to venture
Gryffindor,Lupln,a guess...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...as to what is inside?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"-That's a boggart, that is."
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Now, can anybody tell me"
Gryffindor,Lupln,what a boggart looks like?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
Gryffindor,Lupln,They take the shape of whatever
Gryffindor,Lupln,a person fears the most.
Gryffindor,Lupln,-That's what makes them so--
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Luckily, a very simple charm exists"
Gryffindor,Lupln,to repel a boggart.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Let's practice it now.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Without wands, please."
Gryffindor,Lupln,After me. Riddikulus!
Gryffindor,Lupln,A little louder and very clear.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Keep your nerve. Steady.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Riddikulus!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"And next! Step up, step up!"
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Wonderful, wonderful!"
Gryffindor,Lupln,Here!
Gryffindor,Lupln,Riddikulus!
Gryffindor,Lupln,Right. Sorry about that.
Gryffindor,Lupln,That's enough for today.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Collect your books from the back.
Gryffindor,Lupln,That's the end of the lesson.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Thank you! Sorry!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Sorry, you can have too much"
Gryffindor,Lupln,of a good thing.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade"
Gryffindor,Lupln,village are a privilege.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Should your behavior reflect poorly
Gryffindor,Lupln,on the school...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...that privilege shall not
Gryffindor,Lupln,be extended again.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"No permission form signed,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,no visiting the village.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"That's the rule, Potter."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Those with permission, follow me."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Those without, stay put."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"I thought if you signed it,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,then l could--
Gryffindor,Lupln,I can't. Only a parent
Gryffindor,Lupln,or a guardian can sign.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Since I am neither,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,it would be inappropriate.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"I'm sorry, Potter."
Gryffindor,Lupln,That's my final word.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Professor, can l ask you something?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,"you facing that boggart, yes?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,I thought it'd be obvious.
Gryffindor,Lupln,I assumed it would take the shape
Gryffindor,Lupln,of Lord Voldemort.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Harry.
Gryffindor,Lupln,There you are. You came.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Are you sure about this, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,This is very advanced magic...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...well beyond the Ordinary
Gryffindor,Lupln,Wizarding Level.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Yes!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Well done, Harry. Well done!"
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Eat this, it helps. lt really helps."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"And just so you know, Harry..."
Gryffindor,Lupln,...l think you'd have given your father
Gryffindor,Lupln,a run for his money.
Gryffindor,Lupln,And that is saying something.
Gryffindor,Lupln,I was thinking of him.
Gryffindor,Lupln,And Mum.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Seeing their faces.
Gryffindor,Lupln,They were talking to me.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Just talking.
Gryffindor,Lupln,That's the memory l chose.
Gryffindor,Lupln,I don't even know if it's real.
Gryffindor,Lupln,But it's the best I have.
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Gryffindor,Lupln,Ripped to pieces?
Gryffindor,Lupln,What are you talking about?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,-l haven't lost anything!
Gryffindor,Lupln,-Your cat killed him!
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Harry, you've seen the way"
Gryffindor,Lupln,that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...is always lurking about.
Gryffindor,Lupln,And Scabbers is gone.
Gryffindor,Lupln,take better care of your pets!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Well, first off, the committee members"
Gryffindor,Lupln,took turns...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...talking about why we were there.
Gryffindor,Lupln,I got up and did my piece.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Said how Buckbeak...
Gryffindor,Lupln,"...was a good hippogriff,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,always cleaned his feathers.
Gryffindor,Lupln,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Well, you can imagine."
Gryffindor,Lupln,He said Buckbeak was a deadly
Gryffindor,Lupln,and dangerous creature...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...who would kill you
Gryffindor,Lupln,as soon as look at you.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Come in.
Gryffindor,Lupln,I haven't the faintest idea how this map
Gryffindor,Lupln,came to be in your possession...
Gryffindor,Lupln,"...but quite frankly, l am astounded"
Gryffindor,Lupln,that you didn't hand it in.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Did it never occur to you that this,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,in the hands of Sirius Black...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...is a map to you?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,Your father never set much store
Gryffindor,Lupln,by the rules either.
Gryffindor,Lupln,But he and your mother
Gryffindor,Lupln,gave their lives to save yours.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Gambling their sacrifice
Gryffindor,Lupln,by wandering the castle unprotected...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...with a killer on the loose
Gryffindor,Lupln,seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Now, l will not cover up for you again."
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,I want you to return to your dormitory
Gryffindor,Lupln,and stay there.
Gryffindor,Lupln,And don't take any detours.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"If you do, I shall know."
Gryffindor,Lupln,I don't think that map always works.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
Gryffindor,Lupln,Someone l know to be dead.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Oh, really? And who might that be?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,Peter Pettigrew.
Gryffindor,Lupln,That's not possible.
Gryffindor,Lupln,It's just what l saw.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Good night, professor."
Gryffindor,Lupln,You must look beyond.
Gryffindor,Lupln,The art of crystal gazing
Gryffindor,Lupln,is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Very well. Kill him.
Gryffindor,Lupln,But wait one more minute.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Harry has the right to know why.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Severus--
Gryffindor,Lupln,I told Dumbledore you were helping a
Gryffindor,Lupln,friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Brilliant, Snape."
Gryffindor,Lupln,You've put your keen mind to the task
Gryffindor,Lupln,and come to the wrong conclusion.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"If you'll excuse us,"
Gryffindor,Lupln,Remus and l have business...
Gryffindor,Lupln,-...to attend to.
Gryffindor,Lupln,-Give me a reason. I beg you!
Gryffindor,Lupln,-Don't be a fool.
Gryffindor,Lupln,-He can't help it. It's habit.
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,-Be quiet yourself!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"You two, quarrelling"
Gryffindor,Lupln,like an old married couple.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Run along and play with
Gryffindor,Lupln,your chemistry set!
Gryffindor,Lupln,"I could do it, you know."
Gryffindor,Lupln,But why deny the dementors?
Gryffindor,Lupln,They're so longing to see you.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Oh, yes."
Gryffindor,Lupln,A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
Gryffindor,Lupln,imagine what that must be like.
Gryffindor,Lupln,It's said to be nearly unbearable
Gryffindor,Lupln,"to witness, but l'll do my best."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Severus, please."
Gryffindor,Lupln,After you.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Hello, Harry."
Gryffindor,Lupln,I saw you coming.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"I've looked worse, believe me."
Gryffindor,Lupln,-You've been sacked.
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"No. I resigned, actually."
Gryffindor,Lupln,Resigned? Why?
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Well, it seems that somebody"
Gryffindor,Lupln,let slip the nature of my condition.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"This time tomorrow, the owls will start"
Gryffindor,Lupln,arriving and parents will not want...
Gryffindor,Lupln,"...well, someone like me"
Gryffindor,Lupln,teaching their children.
Gryffindor,Lupln,-But Dumbledore--
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,...risked enough on my behalf.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Besides, people like me are...."
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Well, let's just say"
Gryffindor,Lupln,that I'm used to it by now.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Lupln,None of it made any difference.
Gryffindor,Lupln,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Lupln,-Didn't make any difference?
Gryffindor,Lupln,It made all the difference in the world.
Gryffindor,Lupln,You uncovered the truth.
Gryffindor,Lupln,You saved an innocent man
Gryffindor,Lupln,from a terrible fate.
Gryffindor,Lupln,It made a great deal of difference.
Gryffindor,Lupln,If l am proud of anything...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...it is of how much
Gryffindor,Lupln,you have learned this year.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"Now, since l am no longer"
Gryffindor,Lupln,your teacher...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...l feel no guilt whatsoever
Gryffindor,Lupln,about giving this back to you.
Gryffindor,Lupln,"So now l'll say goodbye, Harry."
Gryffindor,Lupln,I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Gryffindor,Lupln,Until then...
Gryffindor,Lupln,...mischief managed.
Gryffindor,Lupln,upstairs if you don't settle.
Gryffindor,Lupln, Very good.
Gryffindor,Lupln, Very good.
Gryffindor,Lupln, Concentrate. Face your fear.
Gryffindor,Lupln, You want to know why l stopped
Gryffindor,Lupln, I'm sorry to hear
Gryffindor,Lupln, Here we go. Come on.
Gryffindor,Lupln, I know.

Gryffindor,Mr. Weasley, Hermione.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley,Quick. Quick.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley,"Ron, Ron!"
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley,"Oh, for goodness' sake!"
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley,Don't lose him!
Gryffindor,Neville,Riddikulus!
Gryffindor,Neville,"Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!"
Gryffindor,Neville,Incredible! Okay...
Gryffindor,Neville,"...to the back, Neville."
Gryffindor,Neville,"Everyone, form a line...."
Gryffindor,Neville,Form a line!
Gryffindor,Neville,I want everyone to picture the thing
Gryffindor,Neville,they fear the very most...
Gryffindor,Neville,...and turn it into something funny.
Gryffindor,Neville,Next! Ron!
Gryffindor,Neville,Be brave!
Gryffindor,Neville,"Wand at the ready, Ron."
Gryffindor,Neville,Riddikulus!
Gryffindor,Neville,"Yes! You see? Very good, very good!"

Gryffindor,Neville,"Can l have a go, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Neville,"After you, of course."
Gryffindor,Neville,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Neville,Let the man through.
Gryffindor,Neville,"I didn't mean to open it, Harry."

Gryffindor,Neville,They made me do it.
Gryffindor,Neville,Did not.
Gryffindor,Neville,For me?
Gryffindor,Neville,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Neville,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Neville,This came with it.

Gryffindor,Percy,You listen! l'm Head Boy!
Gryffindor,Percy,-Come back here!
Gryffindor,Percy,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
Gryffindor,Percy,"Eyes like the devil, he's got,"
Gryffindor,Percy,and a soul as dark as his name.
Gryffindor,Percy,"It's him, headmaster."
Gryffindor,Percy,The one they all talk about.
Gryffindor,Percy,"He's here, somewhere in the castle!"
Gryffindor,Percy,Sirius Black!
Gryffindor,Percy,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch."
Gryffindor,Percy,"The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
Gryffindor,Percy,and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
Gryffindor,Percy,"No sign of Black, nor anywhere else"
Gryffindor,Percy,in the castle.
Gryffindor,Percy," Let me through, please."
Gryffindor,Percy, Be quiet. The headmaster's here.
Gryffindor,Pettlgrew, James wouldn't have
Gryffindor,Pettlgrew, Turn me into a flobberworm.
No Entry,Petunla, Nothing. He didn't work.
Gryffindor,Ron,I still think it was brilliant.
Gryffindor,Ron,Come on. Everywhere else is full.
Gryffindor,Ron,Who do you think that is?

Gryffindor,Ron,"-lt's on his suitcase, Ronald."
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?

Gryffindor,Ron,Let me get this straight.
Gryffindor,Ron,Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

Gryffindor,Ron,"But they'll catch Black, won't they?"
Gryffindor,Ron,"-l mean, everyone's looking for him."
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,Except no one's ever broken out
Gryffindor,Ron,of Azkaban before...
Gryffindor,Ron,"-...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,Green. That's a monkey.
Gryffindor,Ron,Do not give him one again.
Gryffindor,Ron,"Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
Gryffindor,Ron,Look at him. His face.
Gryffindor,Ron,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
Gryffindor,Ron,Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.
Gryffindor,Ron,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,It's the Grim!
Gryffindor,Ron,-Ah! Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron,"-Ron! Ron, wait!"
Gryffindor,Ron,-Ron!
Gryffindor,Ron,-Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron,-Help!
Gryffindor,Ron,Ah!
Gryffindor,Ron,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
Gryffindor,Ron,"There you are, Potter!"
Gryffindor,Ron,Sirius!
Gryffindor,Ron,"He's my rat, sir."
Gryffindor,Ron,He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
Gryffindor,Ron,He was my brother Percy's rat.
Gryffindor,Ron,-But then they gave him an owl--
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,But the word of three 1 3-year-old
Gryffindor,Ron,wizards will convince few others.
Gryffindor,Ron,"A child's voice,"
Gryffindor,Ron,however honest and true...
Gryffindor,Ron,...is meaningless to those
Gryffindor,Ron,who have forgotten how to listen.
Gryffindor,Ron,"Mysterious thing, time."
Gryffindor,Ron,Powerful...
Gryffindor,Ron,"...and when meddled with,"
Gryffindor,Ron,dangerous.
Gryffindor,Ron,Sirius Black is in the topmost cell
Gryffindor,Ron,of the Dark Tower.
Gryffindor,Ron,"You know the laws, Miss Granger."
Gryffindor,Ron,You must not be seen.
Gryffindor,Ron,"And you would do well, l feel,"
Gryffindor,Ron,to return before this last chime.
Gryffindor,Ron,"If not, the consequences"
Gryffindor,Ron,are too ghastly to discuss.
Gryffindor,Ron,If you succeed tonight...
Gryffindor,Ron,...more than one innocent life
Gryffindor,Ron,may be spared.
Gryffindor,Ron,"Three turns should do it, I think."
Gryffindor,Ron,"Oh, and by the way."
Gryffindor,Ron,"When in doubt, l find retracing"
Gryffindor,Ron,my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Gryffindor,Ron,Good luck.
Gryffindor,Ron,What the bloody hell
Gryffindor,Ron,was that all about?
Gryffindor,Ron,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing"
Gryffindor,Ron,as you can't walk....
Gryffindor,Ron,What just happened?
Gryffindor,Ron,-Where's Ron?
Gryffindor,Ron,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Gryffindor,Ron,Come on. And we can't be seen.
Gryffindor,Ron,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
Gryffindor,Ron,This is not normal.
Gryffindor,Ron,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry."
Gryffindor,Ron,McGonagall gave it to me first term.
Gryffindor,Ron,This is how l've been getting
Gryffindor,Ron,to my lessons all year.
Gryffindor,Ron,-You mean we've gone back in time?
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,Dumbledore obviously wanted us
Gryffindor,Ron,to return to this moment.
Gryffindor,Ron,"Clearly, something happened"
Gryffindor,Ron,he wants us to change.
Gryffindor,Ron,Good punch.
Gryffindor,Ron,Thanks.
Gryffindor,Ron,Malfoy's coming.
Gryffindor,Ron,I'm gonna get that jumped-up

Gryffindor,Ron,"-Harry, you can't."
Gryffindor,Ron,#NAME?
Gryffindor,Ron,-You don't expect me to sit here.
Gryffindor,Ron,"-Yes, and you must!"
Gryffindor,Ron,"Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now."
Gryffindor,Ron,"If you go bursting in,"
Gryffindor,Ron,you'll think you've gone mad.
Gryffindor,Ron,Awful things happen to wizards
Gryffindor,Ron,who meddle with time.
Gryffindor,Ron,We can't be seen.
Gryffindor,Ron,Fudge is coming.
Gryffindor,Ron,And we aren't leaving?
Gryffindor,Ron,Why aren't we leaving?
Gryffindor,Ron,Are you mad?
Gryffindor,Ron,Ow!
Gryffindor,Ron,Ow. That hurt.
Gryffindor,Ron,Sorry.
Gryffindor,Ron,"you see there-- Ah, Hagrid."
Gryffindor,Ron, Brilliant.
Gryffindor,Ron, Do you know everything?
Gryffindor,Ron, What is that?
Gryffindor,Ron, l will.
Gryffindor,Ron, You don't think that Grim thing's
Gryffindor,Ron, You're supposed to stroke it.
Gryffindor,Ron, Who?
Gryffindor,Ron," Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,"
Gryffindor,Ron, Probably Neville forgot
Gryffindor,Ron," Oh, you're there."
Gryffindor,Ron, Serves her right.
Gryffindor,Ron," He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
Gryffindor,Ron," Well, you fell off your broom."
Gryffindor,Ron, Twice.
Gryffindor,Ron, That's not true!
Gryffindor,Ron, Merry Christmas.
Gryffindor,Ron, Your cat killed him!
Gryffindor,Ron, Did.
Gryffindor,Ron, They're not sacking you!
Gryffindor,Ron," Scabbers, come back."
Gryffindor,Ron," Scabbers, you bit me!"
Gryffindor,Ron, So what?
Gryffindor,Ron, A bit? A bit?
Gryffindor,Ron, You better go.
