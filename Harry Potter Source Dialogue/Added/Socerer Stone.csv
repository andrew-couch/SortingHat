Character,Dialogue
Albus," Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
Draco," It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}"
Draco, Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}
Draco," {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}"
Draco," No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
Draco," Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}"
Draco, Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Draco, No!
Draco," Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
Draco, The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!
Draco, Okay. Then I get Fang!
Draco, You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Draco," Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
Draco," {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!"
Draco," Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}"
Dudley," Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
Dudley, How many are there?
Dudley, Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!
Dudley, I don't care how big they are!
Dudley, Make it move.
Dudley, MOVE!
Dudley, He's boring.
Dudley," Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!"
Dudley, Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
Dudley," Mum, mummy!"
Dudley," Mum, help! Help me!"
Dudley," {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!"
Dudley, AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}
Dudley, What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
Dudley," Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!"
Dudley, I-I-I'm not Harry.
Dudley, {whimpers}
Dudley, Ahh!
Dumbledore, I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
Dumbledore," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
Dumbledore, Hagrid is bringing him.
Dumbledore," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
Dumbledore, The only family he has.
Dumbledore, Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
Dumbledore," There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all."
Dumbledore, Good luck...Harry Potter.
Dumbledore," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
Dumbledore, Let the feast...begin.
Dumbledore," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
Dumbledore," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
Dumbledore," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}"
Dumbledore," Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
Dumbledore," What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
Dumbledore, Fine. They're both just fine.
Dumbledore," Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
Dumbledore," {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
Dumbledore," Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}"
Dumbledore," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
Dumbledore," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax."
Dumbledore," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
Dumbledore," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}"
Dumbledore," Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}"
Dumbledore," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom."
Dumbledore," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
Filch," Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}"
Filch," Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
Filch," A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
Filch," Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
Filch," There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}"
Firenze," Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
Firenze," A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
Firenze, Can you think of no one?
Firenze, Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Firenze," Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
Flint, Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}
Flint, {to other members} Take that side!
Flitwick," One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then."
Flitwick," Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
Flitwick, Whooaaa! Ooh.
Fred," Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!"
Fred," I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}"
Fred," Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
Fred," Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard."
George," He's not Fred, I am!"
George," Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
George, But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
Griphook," Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}"
Griphook, Vault 713.
Griphook, Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}
Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
Hagrid," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
Hagrid, Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}
Hagrid," Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}"
Hagrid," {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
Hagrid," Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh."
Hagrid," It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
Hagrid," Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
Hagrid," No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
Hagrid," You're a wizard, Harry."
Hagrid," Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah."
Hagrid, A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
Hagrid, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Hagrid," Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
Hagrid," Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen Albus Dumbledore."
Hagrid, {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.
Hagrid," Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
Hagrid," {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}"
Hagrid, If you know where to go.
Hagrid," No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
Hagrid," Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
Hagrid," Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
Hagrid," See, Harry, you're famous!"
Hagrid," I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}"
Hagrid," Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
Hagrid," Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
Hagrid," They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
Hagrid," Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}"
Hagrid," Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?"
Hagrid," Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
Hagrid," Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
Hagrid," A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
Hagrid, Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}
Hagrid," You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
Hagrid," {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
Hagrid," No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort."
Hagrid, Shh!!
Hagrid," It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}"
Hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
Hagrid," Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
Hagrid," What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
Hagrid," Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
Hagrid," Hello, Harry."
Hagrid," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
Hagrid, Well done!
Hagrid, What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
Hagrid, Go go go!
Hagrid, Looks like he's gonna be sick!
Hagrid, Yes!
Hagrid, Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Hagrid, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
Hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the"
Hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
Hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
Hagrid, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}
Hagrid," {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}"
Hagrid, Oh.
Hagrid," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
Hagrid, Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
Hagrid," You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
Hagrid," That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me."
Hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...
Hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
Hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}"
Hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?"
Hagrid," Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede."
Hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}"
Hagrid," Oh, dear."
Hagrid, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
Hagrid, Right. Let's go.
Hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
Hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}"
Hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}"
Hagrid," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}"
Hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
Hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
Hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
Hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!
Hagrid, Yes! {grins}
Hagrid," Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
Hagrid," Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you."
Hagrid," Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
Hagrid," I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go."
Harry," Yes, Aunt Petunia."
Harry," Yes, Uncle Vernon."
Harry, He's asleep!
Harry," Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you."
Harry," Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
Harry, Anytime.
Harry, {Grins and giggles}
Harry, Ow!
Harry, I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
Harry," Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
Harry," {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---"
Harry, Get off! Ahh!
Harry, They're my letters! Let go of me!
Harry," Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}"
Harry," Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads Happee Birdae Harry.}"
Harry," {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?"
Harry," Sorry, no."
Harry, Learnt what?
Harry, I-I'm a what?
Harry," A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
Harry," No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
Harry," Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"
Harry, You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?
Harry, Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Harry, Muggle?
Harry, {laughs}
Harry, {Nods} Okay.
Harry," All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?"
Harry," Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}"
Harry, Good-bye.
Harry," But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
Harry," But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
Harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?"
Harry," What's in there, Hagrid?"
Harry, I still need...a wand.
Harry, {Softly} Hello? Hello?
Harry, Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}
Harry," Sorry, but what's curious?"
Harry, And...who owned that wand?
Harry, Wow.
Harry," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?
Harry, Voldemort?
Harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Harry, What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?
Harry," Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}"
Harry," Excuse me, excuse me."
Harry," Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?"
Harry, Muggles?
Harry, Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to
Harry," No, not at all."
Harry, I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
Harry, The what?
Harry," Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}"
Harry, {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!
Harry, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Harry," {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
Harry," Hey, I got Dumbledore!"
Harry," Hey, he's gone!"
Harry, Just a little bit.
Harry, Yeah!
Harry," Hey, Hagrid."
Harry," I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Harry, Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}
Harry," Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine."
Harry, {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Harry, Wow.
Harry," Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
Harry, What's he teach?
Harry, I think she fancies you.
Harry, We got lost.
Harry," I don't know, Sir."
Harry," I don't know, Sir."
Harry, What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Harry, Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.
Harry," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
Harry, Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}
Harry, Neville! {shouting}
Harry," Give it here, Malfoy."
Harry," Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
Harry," A century, according to McGonagall."
Harry, But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Harry, I-I didn't know.
Harry, Who doesn't?
Harry, What's happening?
Harry, {taps Ron} Let's go this way.
Harry, Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Harry, Let's go.
Harry, Run!
Harry, It's locked!
Harry," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}"
Harry, Guarding something?
Harry, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}
Harry, I like this ball.
Harry, What do I do with it?
Harry, Whoa.
Harry," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
Harry, I think she heard you.
Harry, Where's Hermione?
Harry, How could a troll get in?
Harry, Hermione! She doesn't know!
Harry, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Harry," Hermione, move!"
Harry," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}"
Harry," Whoa, whoa whoa!"
Harry, Do something! {swipe}
Harry, Anything! Hurry up!
Harry, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.
Harry, I'm not hungry.
Harry, That explains the blood.
Harry," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
Harry," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
Harry, That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
Harry, But I-I never get mail.
Harry, It's a broomstick!
Harry, But who...?
Harry, A little bit.
Harry, What happened?
Harry, Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!
Harry, Yes!
Harry, Whoa! Whooa!
Harry, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
Harry, Yes?
Harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!"
Harry, Exactly.
Harry, Nicholas Flamel?
Harry, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Harry, Knight to E-5.
Harry," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?"
Harry, I've got presents?
Harry, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}
Harry," ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."""
Harry, Some kind of...cloak.
Harry, My body's gone!
Harry, I'm invisible??
Harry," {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well."""
Harry, {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Harry," Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there."
Harry," Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
Harry," There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
Harry," Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
Harry," {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
Harry, How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}
Harry," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
Harry, Shh!
Harry, Hagrid!
Harry, We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Harry," Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
Harry, What?
Harry," Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?"
Harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
Harry, Norbert?
Harry, Malfoy.
Harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?
Harry, 50?!
Harry," Hagrid, what's that?"
Harry," If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
Harry," What is it, Fang?"
Harry, {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?
Harry, But who would choose such a life?
Harry, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Harry, The Philosopher's Stone.
Harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}"
Harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight."
Harry, My scar. It keeps burning.
Harry, Not like this.
Harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}"
Harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?"
Harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
Harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
Harry, He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
Harry, Someone's going to try and steal it.
Harry," That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
Harry, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Harry, Trevor.
Harry," Now, Neville, listen. We were"
Harry, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.
Harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}
Harry, We have to move its paw.
Harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
Harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}
Harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}
Harry, Hermione! Where are you?!
Harry," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Harry, Apparently not.
Harry, What?
Harry," Ron, are you okay?"
Harry, Okay.
Harry, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Harry, I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Harry," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}"
Harry, I don't know. Strange.
Harry, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}
Harry, It's too simple.
Harry, Catch the key!
Harry, Where are we? A graveyard.
Harry, There's the door.
Harry, Wait a minute.
Harry," No, Ron! No!"
Harry, He's going to sacrifice himself!
Harry," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
Harry, Not as good as you.
Harry, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
Harry," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me."
Harry, Snape was trying to...save me?
Harry, Th-then you let the troll in.
Harry, I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.
Harry, Voldemort.
Harry, {shakes his head} Never!
Harry, You liar!
Harry," Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}"
Harry, Admirers?
Harry, Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Harry," But, what happened to the Stone?"
Harry," But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
Harry," How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
Harry," Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
Harry, What is it?
Harry," All right there, Ron?"
Harry, {shrug} All right. Hermione?
Harry, {Pats} Good job.
Harry, One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}
Harry," Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}"
Harry," But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
Harry, I'm not going home. Not really.
Hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Hermione," Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
Hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
Hermione," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}"
Hermione," It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts A History."
Hermione," Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}"
Hermione, Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Hermione, Eugh.
Hermione," I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something."
Hermione, Up. Up. Up. Up.
Hermione," Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot."
Hermione, You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
Hermione, {Gasps.}
Hermione," The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}"
Hermione, We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
Hermione," Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}"
Hermione," Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
Hermione, Filch is gone.
Hermione, It was locked.
Hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
Hermione, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
Hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}"
Hermione," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
Hermione, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}
Hermione, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}
Hermione, Ahhh! Help!
Hermione, Swish and flick!
Hermione, Is it...dead?
Hermione," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}"
Hermione, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
Hermione," Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
Hermione, Blood?
Hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?
Hermione, So you're saying...
Hermione," Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
Hermione, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}
Hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Hermione, Whoo-hoo!
Hermione, That thing has a name?
Hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking."
Hermione, I don't know.
Hermione, That's totally barbaric!
Hermione, See you haven't.
Hermione," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
Hermione, Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}
Hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
Hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
Hermione, It means you'll never die.
Hermione," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
Hermione," {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
Hermione, Is that...a dragon?
Hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
Hermione, Harry!
Hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
Hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
Hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
Hermione, It's happened before.
Hermione, What is it?
Hermione, And with Dumbledore gone
Hermione, Uh...we were just...
Hermione, Now what do we do?
Hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus."
Hermione, Sorry.
Hermione, Ow! You stood on my foot!
Hermione, Alohomora.
Hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.
Hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
Hermione, Are you okay?
Hermione," He's not relaxing, is he?"
Hermione, We've got to do something!
Hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}"
Hermione, What is that?
Hermione, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Hermione, What's this all about?
Hermione, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
Hermione," What's wrong, Harry?"
Hermione, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Hermione, Now what do we do?
Hermione, What happens now?
Hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
Hermione, What is it?
Hermione," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!"
Hermione," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
Hermione," {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
Hermione, {smile} Never better.
Hermione, We're tied with Slytherin!
Hermione," Come on, Harry."
Hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
Hooch," Good afternoon, class."
Hooch," Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!"
Hooch, With feeling!
Hooch," Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}"
Hooch, Mr. Longbottom.
Hooch, {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!
Hooch, Mr. Longbottom!
Hooch, Come back down this instant!
Hooch, Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}
Hooch," Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up."
Hooch," Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}"
Hooch," Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}"
Hooch, {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!
Lee," Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
Lee, The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Lee," The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
Lee, The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Lee, Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}
Lee, Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Lee, Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}
Lee, He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Lee," Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}"
McGonagall," Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
McGonagall, And the boy?
McGonagall, Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
McGonagall," Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are"
McGonagall, This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
McGonagall," Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup"
McGonagall, The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}
McGonagall, We're ready for you now.
McGonagall," All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words."
McGonagall," When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
McGonagall, Draco Malfoy.
McGonagall, Susan Bones.
McGonagall, Ronald Weasley.
McGonagall, Harry Potter.
McGonagall," {dings on a cup} Your attention, please."
McGonagall," Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time."
McGonagall, Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
McGonagall, {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}
McGonagall," Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
McGonagall," Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
McGonagall," Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
McGonagall, Ms. Granger?
McGonagall," Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}"
McGonagall, {Giggles happily}
McGonagall, Good evening.
McGonagall," Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
McGonagall," Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
McGonagall," No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
McGonagall, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
McGonagall, {shocked} How do you know
McGonagall," I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}"
Neville, Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}
Neville," Seamus, that picture's moving!"
Neville," The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
Neville, Oh...
Neville, AHH!
Neville, {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!
Neville, Help!!!
Neville, AHH!
Neville, Help!
Neville," Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!"
Neville, Owowowow.
Neville, Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
Neville," {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
Neville, No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}
Nick, Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
Nick," Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}"
Nick, I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
Nick, Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}
Nick, Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.
OIiver," Scared, Harry?"
Oliver," Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?"
Oliver," ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}"
Oliver," Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
Oliver," You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
Oliver, That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Oliver," Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
Ollivander," I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave."
Ollivander," Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious."
Ollivander," I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}"
Ollivander," Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}"
Percy," Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
Percy, Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.
Percy," Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
Percy," Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you."
Percy," This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
Percy," Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}"
Percy," Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
Percy," {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
Percy, Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!
Petunia, Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}
Petunia," Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
Petunia," Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
Petunia, I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Petunia," Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?"
Petunia, This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
Petunia, {Sees him} AHH!
Petunia, My darling boy! How did you get in there?!
Petunia, It's all right. It's all right.
Petunia," Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
Petunia, Ooh.
Petunia," Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you."
Petunia, We had to tell him something.
Quirrell, Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Quirrell," F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
Quirrell, An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry You wait here.} an essential in-gredient
Quirrell," Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}"
Quirrell, TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}
Quirrell, Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....
Quirrell, Severus...I-I thought...
Quirrell, W-what do you m-mean?
Quirrell," Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"""
Quirrell," No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse."
Quirrell, I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
Quirrell," Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
Quirrell," Come here, Potter, now!"
Quirrell, Tell me. What do you see?
Quirrell, What is it?! What do you see?!
Quirrell, Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Quirrell," Master, you are not strong enough."
Quirrell, Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}
Quirrell," {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!"
Ron," Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
Ron," {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
Ron," So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the..."
Ron, {whispers} Scar...?
Ron, Wicked.
Ron," {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}"
Ron, Whoa!
Ron," They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
Ron," It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself."
Ron," Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
Ron, I got about 6 of him.
Ron," Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?"
Ron, Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Ron, {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-
Ron, No.
Ron," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
Ron, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.
Ron, Whoaa!
Ron, Wicked.
Ron," Mental that one, I'm telling you."
Ron, There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.
Ron," Harry, what is it?"
Ron, {Sighs}
Ron, Ahh!
Ron," Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!"
Ron, Ahh!
Ron," Look at that one, Harry!"
Ron," Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?"
Ron, That was bloody brilliant.
Ron," Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before..."
Ron, Ah. Mail's here!
Ron," Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}"
Ron, Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
Ron," Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
Ron," Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}"
Ron," Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
Ron," I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
Ron, Ahh!
Ron," Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}"
Ron, It's Filch's cat!
Ron," That's it, we're done for!"
Ron, Alohomora?
Ron, Probably thinks this door's locked.
Ron, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Ron," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}"
Ron, She needs to sort out her priorities!
Ron, Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}
Ron," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
Ron," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
Ron," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?"
Ron," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}"
Ron, Ew.
Ron, What? {swipe}
Ron," Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron Cool.) It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard."
Ron," Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
Ron, Let's open it.
Ron," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!"
Ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Ron," Come on, Hermione!"
Ron, Go!
Ron, Fluffy?
Ron, Queen to E-5.
Ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.
Ron," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!"
Ron, We've looked a hundred times!
Ron, I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Ron," {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
Ron," Happy Christmas, Harry."
Ron," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!"
Ron, Yeah!
Ron, There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}
Ron, What is it?
Ron," Well, let's see then. Put it on."
Ron, Whoa!
Ron, I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!
Ron, {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.
Ron, Why?
Ron, I only see me.
Ron," That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
Ron, This is light?
Ron, Immortal?
Ron, I know what it means!
Ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
Ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Ron, {laughs}
Ron," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
Ron, It's bad.
Ron, {weakly} Okay.
Ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?"
Ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!"
Ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
Ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Ron," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
Ron," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
Ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}"
Ron, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}
Ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping."
Ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!
Ron, What?!
Ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}"
Ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
Ron," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
Ron, Now what are we gonna do?!
Ron, Ahh! Harry!
Ron, Harry!
Ron, Help!
Ron, Help! Help me!
Ron, Ahhh!
Ron, Yeah.
Ron, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Ron," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try."
Ron, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
Ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
Ron, This complicates things a bit!
Ron, Hurry up!
Ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}"
Ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}"
Ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}"
Ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
Ron," Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
Ron," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
Ron," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3."
Ron, Check.
Ron, Ahhhh!
Ron, All right? You?
Seamus, I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Seamus," Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
Seamus," Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
Seamus," Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione Well done, dear.}"
Seamus, Neville! {Shakes his hand.}
Snake, Thankssssssss.
Snape," There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention."
Snape," Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}"
Snape, And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?
Snape," Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?"
Snape," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}"
Snape," What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}"
Snape," You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
Snape," You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
Snape," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
Snape," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}"
Tom, Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
Vernon," Happy birthday, son."
Vernon," Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
Vernon, Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
Vernon," Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!"
Vernon," I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
Vernon, Move!
Vernon, What happened?
Vernon, {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!
Vernon," Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk."
Vernon, {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
Vernon, No more mail through this letterbox.
Vernon, Shoo! Go on!
Vernon," Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
Vernon," Go away, ahh!"
Vernon, Give me that! Give me that letter!
Vernon, Ahh!
Vernon, That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Vernon, Who's there? Ahh!
Vernon," I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!"
Vernon, Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!
Vernon, He'll not be going!
Vernon, I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Voldemort," Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!"
Voldemort, Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Voldemort," Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}"
Voldemort, Kill him!
Voldemort, Fool! Get the stone!
Voldemort, Arrrhhhhhh!
