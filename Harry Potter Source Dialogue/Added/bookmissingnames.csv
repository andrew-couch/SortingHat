Harry,goblet_of_fire,"  ""Yeah, all right,"" said Harry, slightly surprised.",Gryffindor
Harry,goblet_of_fire,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry curiously.",Gryffindor

Harry,goblet_of_fire,"  ""I'll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,"" said Harry.",Gryffindor
Harry,goblet_of_fire," ""Just stay with him,"" said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.",Gryffindor
Harry,goblet_of_fire," ""Just keep him here,"" said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch.",Gryffindor
Harry,goblet_of_fire," ""Look,"" said Harry angrily, ""Crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he says he wants to warn -""  The stone wall behind Snape slid open.",Gryffindor
