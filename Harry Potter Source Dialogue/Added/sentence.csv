Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Vernon,No Entry,Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Vernon,No Entry,"For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle's sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Petunia,No Entry,"  The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, 'You're a nasty little liar."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Don't think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Vernon,No Entry,"'The noble sport', as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley's first punchball."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"  'You're not allowed,' Dudley said at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Don't ever talk about that again,' Harry snarled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry hissed, 'I'm trying to lis- '    But he fell silent."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry groaned, wondering whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley's weight."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,    Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley's bulk.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Petunia,No Entry,"Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley's leather jacket."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Right,' Harry said, 'I've changed my mind, I'm staying.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Son,#N/A,"  'Go on, son,' said Uncle Vernon, 'what did he do?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"  'Pointed his wand at me,' Dudley mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"  'All went dark,' Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering 'Everything dark."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"  'Yes,' Dudley whispered, still trembling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Ignoring Uncle Vernons ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Voldemort,Slytherin,"    'Lord Voldemort,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"that was the one who - '    'Murdered my parents, yes,' Harry said dully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Remus,#N/A,"    'Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,' said a bald black wizard standing furthest back - he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear - 'he looks exactly like James.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Remus,#N/A,"  'And this is Nymphadora - '    'Don't call me Nymphadora, Remus,' said the young witch with a shudder, 'it's Tonks.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nymphadora,#N/A,"  'So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora,' muttered Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No, I wouldn't mind,' Harry mumbled, turning away."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, 'In a minute.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Get in quick, Harry,' Lupin whispered, 'but don't go far inside and don't touch anything.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"    'Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I've really got to dash,' Mrs Weasley whispered distractedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"When we heard - and that Ministry hearing - it's just outrageous, I've looked it all up, they can't expel you, they just can't, there's provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations - '    'Let him breathe, Hermione,' said Ron, grinning as he closed the door behind Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yeah,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well, I'm glad he left,' Harry said coldly 'II he hadn't, I wouldn't have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He could still've kept me informed if he'd wanted to,' Harry said shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hello, Harry' said George, beaming at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Tonks told me how to find out,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  At Harry's words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Whatever you do, don't mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,' Ron told Harry in a tense voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Because every time Percy's name's mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he's holding and Mum starts crying,' Fred said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody's having any contact with Dumbledore,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Percy,Gryffindor,'Percy said the only evidence was your word and .
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, no, she's kept her promise - not that she's got any choice,' Hermione added with satisfaction."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Don't I hey think I'd rather it'd never- '    'We know, Harry' said Ginny earnestly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, 'We knew you'd be angry, Harry, we really don't blame you, but you've got to understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore -    'Yeah, I know,' said Harry shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Snape never eats here,' Ron told Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"C'mon.'    'And don't forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,' Hermione whispered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'We're eating down in the kitchen,' Mrs Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Sit down, Harry' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dung,#N/A,"  The meeting's over, Dung,' said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'And if you want dinner before midnight I'll need a hand,' Mrs Weasley said to the room at large."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Sirius,' said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation, but had been closely examining an empty goblet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'Boys,' Mr Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, 'your mother's right, you re supposed to show a sense f responsibility now you've come of age - '    'None of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"  'It looks wonderful, Molly,' said Lupin, ladling stew on to a plate lor her and handing it across the table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"  'Beg pardon, Molly,' said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and winking at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'He's useful,' Sirius muttered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"  'Not just yet, Molly,' said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'You haven't forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"  'I don't intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"    'I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,' said Sirius coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Son,#N/A,"I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry's best interests at heart -'    'He's not your son,' said Sirius quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,' said Lupin sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I want to know what's been going on,' Harry said at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"'I absolutely forbid - '    'Molly you can't stop Fred and George,' said Mr Weasley wearily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Course I will,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Voldemort doesn't march up to people's houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, 'Like a weapon."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'All right, Ron, Harry,' said Mrs Weasley on the second landing, pointing them into their bedroom."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    ""Night,' Harry and Ron said to the twins."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'We can't let them out to hunt every night,' Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"    'Kreacher,' said Ron as he turned off the light."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,  The weapon Sirius mentioned?'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end    'Cover your faces and take a spray,' Mrs Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more boitles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Kreachers really old, he probably couldn't manage - '    'You'd be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wnnts to, Hermione,' said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Right you are, Sirius,' said Mrs Weasley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Close the door, please, Harry,' said Mrs Weasley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Right-o,' Fred said brightly, spraying the Doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs Weasley's back was turned he pocketed it with a wink."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'We want to experiment with Doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,' George told Harry under his breath."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Range of sweets to make you ill,' George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs Weasley's back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,' Fred muttered, frowning with concentration."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"    'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"    'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second box to George, adding in a clear undertone, 'and there its twin, unnataral little beasts they are.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"    This is Harry, Kreacher,' said Hermione tentatively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, 'he's not in his tight mind, he doesn't know what he's - '    'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it - '    'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Junior,Slytherin,"  'Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch junior,' said Sirius, in the same brusque voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Sorry,' said Harry quickly, 'I didn't mean - I was just surprised, that's all - '    'It doesn't matter, don't apologise,' Sirius mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'It's ideal for Headquarters, of course; Sirius said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Don't worry,' Sirius said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'Hurry up, you two, or there won't be any food left,' Mrs Weasley called."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'M - m - morning, Harry,' yawned Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'It'll all be over soon,' Mr Weasley said bracingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,' said Tonks earnestly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You'll be all right, Harry,' said Tonks, palling him on the arm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Mr Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Over here, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Eric,#N/A,"  Thank you, Eric,' said Mr Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'Just inter-departmental memos,' Mr Weasley muttered to him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'This is us, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"    'Mr Weasley,' said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, 'aren't we still underground?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'Morning, Weasley,' said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Quick, Harry,' said Mr Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_August,#N/A,"  'Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,' said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, 'into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry-James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley - '    'Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,' said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once 'That situation has always been closely monitored, given ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'You have heard it from an eyewitness,' Dumbledore interrupted."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_August,#N/A,"    The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore didn't say - '    'Cleared,' Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, 'of all charges!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"Patronus Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,' said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'Mr Weasley,' said Harry slowly, 'if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he's seeing them alone, how do we know they haven't put the Imperius Curse on him?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Don't think it hasn't occurred to us, Harry,' said Mr Weasley quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Scar,' Harry mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    '[ don't think he'll be able to, Ron,' said Mrs Weasley, setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'That's a bit harsh, Hermione,' said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger, 'you wouldn't want to be stuck inside this house without any company.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I'll sponsor you to shut up about SPEW,' Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him.*Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, 'and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Ron's prefect, not me,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Ginny said the booklists had come at last,' she said, glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  Fred and George burst out laughing, and Ron muttered, 'Drop it, Hermione.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'We're going to have to watch our step, George,' said Fred, pretending to tremble, 'with these two on our case ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well done, Hermione,' said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, 'brilliant."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Cool,' Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Nah, I've caused too much trouble,' Harry said, echoing Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Dung likes his little joke,' Fred said to Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Be careful,' Harry warned them quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"  'Molly' said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Percy,Gryffindor,"  'Don't worry about Percy,' said Sirius abruptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Harry, you're to come with me and Tonks,' shouted Mrs Weasley over the repeated screeches of 'MUDBLOODS!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"oh, for heavens sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"  Thanks, Lee,' said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I'll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,' said Moody, 'that's the second time he's not turned up in a week."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'We're - well - Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carnage,' Hermione said awkwardly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Come on,' Ginny told him, 'if we get a move on we'll be able to save them places.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"There's room in this one, there's only Loony Lovegood in here - '    Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"hello, Harry,' said a nervous voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'Malfoy,' replied Harry at once, certain his worst fear would be confirmed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Parkinson,#N/A,"  'And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,' said Hermione viciously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'She didn't enjoy it very much,' Luna informed him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'Shut up, Malfoy,' said Hermione sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  He can't have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati and Lavender could not hear, 'Maybe he's not back yet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, indeed,' said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across Neville towards her (Neville winced; it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you)."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"(Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged smirks.)    'Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr Filch's office door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Parvati,Gryffindor,"  'I'll be her friend as long as I don't have to borrow that cardigan,' Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent giggles."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hey, Harry,' said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Seamus,Gryffindor,"  He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, 'Look ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Seamus,Gryffindor,"    'That's out of order, Seamus,' said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red - always a danger sign."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"We believe Harry,' said Neville simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"  'Don't worry about it, Harry,' Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder, 'he's just ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I listen, Ron,' said Hermione, with a touch of asperity."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You'll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,' said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  ' - now that we've got our OWLs,' George said hastily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho's robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold 'T' was pinned."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bell,#N/A,"    'It means they're not real fans, they're just jumping on the bandwagon - '    That's the bell,' said Harry dully, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Tell me, Potter,' said Snape softly, 'can you read?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Granger,#N/A,"    'Hermione Granger,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"    'Weasley,' said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well, it's like Harry said, isn't it?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'No, but - '    Professor Umbridge talked over him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day - '    'No we haven't,' Hermione said, 'we just - '    'Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"  'It says here she's given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,' Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge's note again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'What I don't get,' said Harry through clenched teeth, laying down his knife and fork (his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady), 'is why they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told them ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"'You know what it's like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job; they say it's jinxed.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  Thank you for your support, Ron,' Hermione said acidly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You handled it fine by yourself,' Ron mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I wouldn't bet on it,' Ron told her cuttingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,' said Hermione at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bell,#N/A,"When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds, Harry rolled up his blood-stained Bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in Hermione's handkerchief, and Malfoy's derisive laughter still ringing in his ears."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Because she'll never be as good as Hagrid,' said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'You can laugh,' Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing, 'but people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.'    'Er - thanks very much, Ernie,' said Harry, taken aback but pleased."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Evening, Professor Umbridge,' Harry said stiffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'You know what to do, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Then Hermione said, 'But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn't Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'm not doing anything wrong,' Harry called after her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, 'I can't, it's gone.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Thanks,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle, Cho said, 'I'm going this way."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Morning,' Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he joined them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,' Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Exactly the attitude I want, Harry' said Angelina approvingly soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Pass it on, Ron,' called Angelina, as though nothing had happened."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Come on now, Ron,' said Angelina crossly, as he dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Here, take this,' Fred told her, handing her something small anc purple from out of his pocket, 'it'll clear it up in no time.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I suppose he could've played better,' Harry muttered, 'but it was only the first training session, like you said ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week, Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall's long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra's equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter's many moons."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'He is - ' Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy's letter in half 'the world's - ' he tore it into quarters 'biggest - ' he tore it into eighths 'git.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Thanks a million, Hermione,' said Harry weakly, passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'OK, write that down,' Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, 'then add this conclusion I've written for you.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I think a girl - first-year, by the look of her - might've get a glimpse of me earlier, but don't worry,' Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth, '] was gone the moment she looked back at me and I'll bet she just thought I was an oddly-shaped log or something.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Molly,Gryffindor,"  'You sound like Molly,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,' said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione's winces."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"After all, you are the only member of his family he's got left, and Professor Dumbledore said - '    'So, what are Umbridge's lessons like?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    There was a pause at this, then Ron said, That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Madame Maxime was with him, we've been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home - but there's nothing to suggest he's hurt or - well, nothing to suggest he's not perfectly OK.'    Unconvinced, Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Listen, don't go asking too many questions about Hagrid,' said Sirius hastily, 'it'll just draw even more attention to the fact that he's not back and I know Dumbledore doesn't want that."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"Hagrid's tough, he'll be OK.' And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, 'When's your next Hogsmeade weekend, anyway?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"'Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius - you know, Lucius Malfoy - so don't come up here, whatever you do."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,    Hermione read aloud:'In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, 'Some people got a ""D""?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, 'I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to OWL standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd got an ""O"" - '    'Hermione,' said Ron sharply, 'if you want to know what grades we got, ask.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'And then ""T"",' George reminded her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Alicia,Gryffindor,"Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Trelawney,Ravenclaw,"  'Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,' said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I did it last time,' Ron protested, 'it's your turn, you tell me one.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I dunno, last night, whenever you like,' Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"Then -    'I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge sleekly.*The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and, by the following morning, it was bleeding again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'From Professor Umbridge,' muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' Harry muttered, speaking to the floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry said, furious at this injustice, 'I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,' said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,' said Harry angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting for us out there."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,' Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'But that was luck,' said Harry, 'it wasn't skill - '    'Second year,' Ron interrupted, 'you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up, I - '    Third year,' said Ron, louder still, 'you fought off about a hundred Dementors at once - '    'You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't - '    'Last year,' Ron said, almost shouting now, 'you fought off You-know-Who again - '    'Listen to me!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Reparo,' Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I was wondering,' Hermione said suddenly, 'whether you'd thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, 'but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Don't worry, Harry,' Hermione said quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I don't know about this, Hermione,' Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '    'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him, you won't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  Zacharias said dismissively, 'All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know - '    'If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Summer,#N/A,"  'And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, 'great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of - '    They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out - '    'You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,' Harry reminded him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I reckon you'll be OK with Gobstones,' Ron said darkly, making the second-year jump."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry said, looking round at the door to the girls' dormitories."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Michael,Ravenclaw,"    'I'll tell Michael,' said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her bench, 'the fool, honestly ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'm looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,' Harry explained."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Don't rise,' Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I had to stop you,' Harry gasped, picking up his bag."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Merlin,#N/A,"  'What in the name of Merlin,' said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, 'was that about?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time, 'not pomegranate juice!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Fourteen years,' Snape replied."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'No marks again, then, Potter,' said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry's cauldron with a wave of his wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Professor,' said Parvati, 'do you mean ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'You and Umbridge have got something in common,' Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defence Against the Dark Arts."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"There will be - '    ' - no need to talk,' Harry, Ron and Hermione said together, under their breaths.*'No Quidditch practice,' said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the common room after dinner that night."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"At long last, Fred had closed the doorway to the boys' dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Fred and George told me it's blocked,' said Harry, shaking his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"but I bet she'd know what we'd done,' Fred said out of the corner of his mouth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'We could try the Fever Fudge,' George muttered, 'no one's seen that yet - '    'Does it work?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' Harry muttered, sinking on to a bench and rubbing his forehead."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"  Wait a moment - there is something you can do for me, Dobby,' said Harry slowly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"  'Not tonight, Dobby,' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,  'Dumbledore told you about it?'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hold it,' Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand and muttering, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."""
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"'Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,' Harry said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  You can practise with me,' Harry told him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Sorry Harry,' said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Don't mind her,' Cho muttered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"And then there's his Umgubular Slashkilter - '    'Don't ask,' Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Hey, Harry,' Hermione called from the other end of the room, 'have you checked the time?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  That was really, really good, Harry,' said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Chance,#N/A,"    'Fat chance,' said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air, 'I haven't got any real Galleons to confuse it with.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they came within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time, too."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You just need some breakfast,' Harry said bracingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"'Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'We'll be there in a bit,' Harry assured her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Good luck, Ron,' said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mould,' Harry assured her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"A few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague's watchstrap."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Crabbe,Slytherin,"  'It was that thug Crabbe,' said Angelina angrily, 'he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you'd got the Snitch - but we won, Harry, we won!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you, I do not care if he insulted every family member you possess, your behaviour was disgusting and I am giving each of you a week's worth of detentions!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Walking,' Ron mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I'm sorry, Ron mumbled, looking at his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  This is all my fault - '    'You didn't make me punch Malfoy,' said Harry angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,' said Hermione anxiously, 'some of those cuts look nasty.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,' Hagrid said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the Dementors - '    Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, on to the floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, all righ',' Hagrid said in a resigned voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'It was def'nitely on some o' their minds,' said Hagrid, shrugging, 'but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Hermione said, 'Wow!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Blimey, Hagrid,' said Ron quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Blimey, Hagrid,' said Ron quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    But Hermione said, 'What do you mean ""at one point"", Hagrid?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,' Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Look, Hagrid,' said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretence, 'Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,And then he came stumping out of the Forest - '    Harry groaned.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"Some, like Fred, George and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid's enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Trelawney,Ravenclaw,"Professor Trelawney told me once - '    'No, no, no,' said Hagrid, chuckling, 'tha's jus' superstition, that is, they aren' unlucky, they're dead clever an' useful!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"This one,' he patted the first horse to have appeared, 'name o' Tenebrus, he's my special favourite, firs' one born here in the Forest - '    'Are you aware,' Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, 'that the Ministry of Magic has classified Thestrals as ""dangerous""?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Umbridge said they're dangerous,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well, it's like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,' said Hermione impatiently, 'and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn't usually show them to us before NEWT level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren't they?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Goyle,Slytherin,"    He, Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle, then broke into a chorus of 'Weasley is our King'."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: :But you're coming too!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  'Ginny Weasley,' said Katie."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kirke,#N/A,"  'Andrew Kirke,' said Alicia without enthusiasm, 'and Jack Sloper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He did know this stuff,' Harry said heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Ron,' said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot, 'you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, 'One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Ron demanded, as he and Harry climbed the boys' stairs."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"Cho shouted, 'Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog Cards, look!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"    'I believe you, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"They passed Mrs Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but Professor McGonagall said, 'Shoo!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwartss most celebrated Heads,' Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'We will need,' Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, 'a warning.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"    'I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Come here, then,' Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said 'three', Harry looked up at him - they were very close together - and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry's face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Thineas Nigellus said Arthur's been badly injured - '    'Ask Harry,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  Ginny said, 'Somebody else could have told us ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"Sirius suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys' looks of disgust were answer enough."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Sirius,' Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  When he paused for breath, Sirius said, 'Did you tell Dumbledore this?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'We'll wait outside, Molly,' Tonks said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"    'It's two weeks till full moon,' Mr Weasley reminded her quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  ' - got - er - me,' Mr Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in - '    When you say you were ""on duty"",' Fred interrupted in a low voice, 'what were you doing?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Harry,' said Ron's voice, from far, far away, 'Mum says dinners ready, but she'll save you something if you want to stay in bed.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '    'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"  'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Let's not stay long,' Ron said quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Agnes,#N/A,"  'Here you are, Agnes,' said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  But Neville said quietly, Thanks, Mum.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,'Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone .
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what Mrs Weasley called 'fits of the sullens', in which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, 'but Black - '    'I'm his godfather,' said Sirius, louder than ever."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'How touching,' Snape sneered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,' Snape said sleekly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snivelus,#N/A,"  'I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, 'I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better - '    'Oh, but why don't you tell him so?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Arthur,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing, Arthur,' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Voldemort,Slytherin,"  'Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'll let you know in the usual way when the next one is,' Harry said over and over again, 'but I can't do it tonight, I've got to go to - er - remedial Potions.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"That I'm really stup - '    'Hi, Harry,' said a voice behind him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'We'll be in the library, Harry,' said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,' said Snape, his eyes narrowed malevolently, 'but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ""sir"" or ""Professor"" at all times.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'You have no subtlety, Potter,' said Snape, his dark eyes glit-te'ing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind-reading to Harry, and he didn't like the sound of it at all."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"    'Do not interrupt me, Potter,' said Snape in a dangerous voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,' Snape muttered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'My Aunt Marge,' Harry muttered, hating Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"    'Manners, Potter,' said Snape dangerously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Clear your mind, Potter,' said Snape's cold voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Well, I'm finding that hard at the moment,' Harry snarled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' Harry said, still rubbing his prickling scar, which was becoming more painful."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' Harry mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'In the Department of Mysteries, it's got to be,' Harry whispered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Hermione told me to come and check on you,' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"There you are, Harry,' said Ron, looking awestruck."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'He can hardly say, ""Sorry, everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort"" - stop whimpering, Ron - ""and now Voldemort's worst supporters have broken out, too."""
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We saw him,' Hermione whispered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"make it easier for You-Know-    'Shut up, Ron,' said Hermione angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, 'Well - er - shall we go, then?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well - I have talked about it,' Harry said in a whisper, 'to Ron and Hermione, but - '    'Oh, you'll talk to Hermione Granger!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, it's yeh, Harry,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"Then Hagrid said abruptly, 'In the same boat, yeh an' me, aren' we, 'Any?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid,' said Harry, unable to stop himself, 'where are you getting all these injuries?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"tha's jus' normal bumps an' bruises, Harry,' said Hagrid c.ismissively 'I got a rough job.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rita,Slytherin,"  'Fire away, then, Rita,' said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'It's the right thing to do, Harry,' said Neville, who was sitting opposite him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am, too,' Hermione added as an afterthought."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'But I don't think you're ugly,' said Harry, bemused."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'You should write a book,' Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, 'translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione,' said Harry, shaking his head, 'you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Angelina still won't let him resign,' Ginny said, as though reading Harry's mind."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  Then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they bombarded me with questions,' Hermione told Harry, her eyes shining, 'and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    If anything more was needed to complete Harry's happiness, it was the reaction he got from Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle, He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library; they were with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rookwood,#N/A,"  'I do not blame you, Rookwood,' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Avery,#N/A,    'Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rookwood,#N/A,"    'Stand up, Rookwood,' whispered Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  That is just as well, Potter,' said Snape coldly, 'because you a;-e neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"'One - two - '    Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before Snape cried, 'Legllimens!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  This is Firenze,' said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,' said Firenze."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"There were oohs and gasps and Ron said audibly, 'Blimey!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, 'Harry Potter, a word, please.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'You may stay,' Firenze told him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You've got to think of something happy,' Harry reminded him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cornelius,No Entry,"    'Nothing at all, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,' said Umbridge smugly 'He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - '    'Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dolores,#N/A,"  The purpose of Potters meeting with these students,' continued Professor Umbridge, 'was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age - '    'I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,' said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Just nod or shake your head, dear,' Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, 'come on, now, that won't re-activate the jinx.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dolores,#N/A,"  'I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,' said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he looked angry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,' said Kingsley, in his deep, slow voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dolores,#N/A,"  'Dolores,' said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, 'the meeting tonight - the one we know definitely happened - '    'Yes,' said Umbridge, pulling herself together, 'yes ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cornelius,No Entry,"    'Dumbledore's Army, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge's face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Minerva,#N/A,"  'Well, Minerva,' said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, 'I'm afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'It's only teachers who can dock points from houses, Malfoy,' said Ernie at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_King,#N/A,"  'I know prefects can't dock points, Weasel King,' sneered Maltby."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Granger,#N/A,"  'The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,' said Malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver 'I' on his robes just beneath his prefect's badge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Granger,#N/A,"    'Wise move, Granger,' breathed Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, 'let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Impressive,' Harry said quietly, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'You're late, Potter,' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Draco,Slytherin,"  'It's all right, Draco,' said Snape, lowering his wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"Potter,' said Snape, 'we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"Malfoy mouthed, 'Remedial Potions?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"  Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, 'Expelliarmus!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, 'Petrificus Totalus!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lily,Gryffindor,"  'I don't want you to make him apologise,' Lily shouted, rounding on James."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I've told you,' Harry muttered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron's timetable with her wand so that il flashed a different colour according to its subject."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Marietta,#N/A,"    That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been?
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"And hadn't James replied, 'It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"    'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"    'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"Then Lupin said quietly, 'I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You can't tell me you've stopped having funny dreams,' Hermione    said now, 'because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You can't tell me you've stopped having funny dreams,' Hermione    said now, 'because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Harry,' said a hoarse voice in Harry's ear."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'Firenze said they're angry because he went to work for Dumbledore,' Harry said, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid's profile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Firenze said they're angry because he went to work for Dumbledore,' Harry said, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid's profile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"all righ',' Hagrid whispered back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him    'But you've lasted this long - ' Hermione said tentatively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You want us to teach him,' Harry said in a hollow voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,' Hagrid said, beaming ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'I thought we told you, Hagrid,' said a deep male voice, 'That you are no longer welcome here?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,' said Magorian."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"It's not up ter yeh who comes an' goes in here - '    'No more is it up to you, Hagrid,' said Magorian smoothly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid,' said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground, 'let's go, please let's go!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Hagrid,' said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, 'if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest, it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able - '    Ah, you heard what they said, said Hagrid dismissively, they wouldn't hurt foals - I mean, kids."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Nice try,' Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Song,#N/A,"'And I wish they'd stop singing that stupid song,' said Hermione miserably, 'haven't they gloated enough?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'It was Hagrid,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"  'As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 'your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"I wasn't sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much - and on question twenty-three - '    'Hermione,' said Ron sternly, 'we've been through this before ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Flitwick,Ravenclaw,"  Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, 'Parkinson, Pansy - Patil, Padma - Patil, Parvati - Potter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Professor Tofty is free, Potter,' squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    Hagrid roared, 'Reasonable be damned, yeh won' take me like this, Dawlish!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  I'm - I'm fine, sir,' Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"    'I need to see Professor McGonagall,' gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"    'She's not here, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey sadly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'I don't wonder you're shocked, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in her face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Come with me,' Harry said quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Then Ron said, 'G-get there?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Harry,' said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, 'er ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I've been - '    'You've never been there, Harry,' said Hermione quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry shouted at her, 'I'm not having nightmares, I'm not just dreaming!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'But Harry, you've just said it,' said Hermione fiercely, 'Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you'd done Occlumency properly you'd never have seen this - '    'IF YOU THINK I'M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN - '    'Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, 'Yeah, we'll do it,' and Luna said, 'When you say ""Sirius"", are you talking about Stubby Boardman?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, 'Yeah, we'll do it,' and Luna said, 'When you say ""Sirius"", are you talking about Stubby Boardman?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'OK,' Harry said aggressively to Hermione, 'OK, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I'm with you, otherwise I'm going to the Department of Mysteries right now.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, 'I think that's as good as we're going to get, Harry - cone on, let's do it.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, 'Good one ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"  'It's the Potter boys head in the fire,' Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"'You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,' she nodded at Ron - Malfoy laughed even louder - 'to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes - 'Mr Filch having just informed me so."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Ah, Professor Snape,' said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,'We j - j - just did what P - P - Professor Dumbledore told us t - t - to do.'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Professor,' said Malfoy eagerly, 'Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after - '    'I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'No, I don't think so, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione, keep your voice down,' Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ronan,No Entry,"    'They brought her here, Ronan,' replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'You're too - ' Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, 'I'm three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosophers Stone, and it's because of me that Malfoy's stuck back in Umbridge's office with giant flying bogies attacking him - '    'Yeah, but - '    'We were all in the DA together,' said Neville quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  This is mad,' Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horses neck."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,' Harry said very quickly, 'Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'We're coming with you, Harry,' said Neville."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Someone shut the door,' Harry muttered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  This is it,' Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech, 'it's through here - '    He glanced around at them all; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'    'Keep your wands ready,' Harry said softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He should be near here,' whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Don't, Harry,' said Neville suddenly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Don't do anything,' Harry muttered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,' said Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Do not play games with us, Potter,' said Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, 'Smash shelves - '    'Dumbledore never told you?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  ""Whaddever you do, Harry,' said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, 'don'd gib it to him!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hermione,' Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Neville, we're not far from the exit,' Harry whispered, 'we're right next to that circular room ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Harry,' said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, 'there you are ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Harry,' said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, 'you know who this girl is, Harry?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Now, Potter - '    He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, 'Protego!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Springing up, Harry yelled, 'Petrificus Totalus!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He can't come back, Harry,' said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bella,#N/A,"'Master, you should know - '    'Be quiet, Bella,' said Voldemort dangerously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tom,No Entry,"  'It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,' said Dumbledore calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,' Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: 'Stay where you are, Harry!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cornelius,No Entry,"    'If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore - apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor) - 'you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, Harry,' said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, 'you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night's events.'"

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own - '    That's enough, Phineas,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  There  is  no  shame   in  what  you  are   feeling,  Harry,'  said Dumbledore's voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Let me out,' Harry said again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Let me out,' Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore's."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'And,' whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, 'and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him - '    'She was quite right, Harry,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Kreacher's a lying - foul - he deserved - '    'Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual - '    'Harry you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,' said Dumbledore steadily, 'but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"'I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence - '    'Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him - ' Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on '- how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my - '    'I trust Severus Snape,' said Dumbledore simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"    'Sirius did not hate Kreacher,' said Dumbledore."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  The prophecy's smashed,' Harry said blankly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,' said Dumbledore hesitantly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,Harry was sitting on the end of Ron's bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sunday Prophet.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, they're very complimentary about you now, Harry,' said Hermione, scanning down the article."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Granger,#N/A,"    'So that's fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,' said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor s hour-glass as she spoke."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'm fine,' Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid's mind."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Arthur,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,' said Moody."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry,' said Mr Weasley, still smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'Bye, then, Potter,' said Moody, grasping Harry's shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Take care, Harry,' said Lupin quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"    'Harry, we'll have you away from there as soon as we can,' Mrs Weasley whispered, hugging him again."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well, it changes every day, you see,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    That's all you know,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'No more do I,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'We're not stupid, you know,' said Uncle Vernon."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, that's news to me,' said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Gordon,#N/A,"  'Round at my place, my parents will be out,' said Gordon."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"  'See you then,' said Dudley."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Cool name,' said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside is cousin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago - '    'He was asking for it,' snarled Dudley."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley's low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Nothing,' said Harry, slightly less calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"That wasn't me - '    'Was,' muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quieten him while they both bent low over Dudley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'Go on, son,' said Uncle Vernon, 'what did he do?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dudley,No Entry,"  'T-tripped,' said Dudley shakily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"    'OK,' said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley's forehead to feel his temperature."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'De - men - tors,' said Harry slowly and clearly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'Enough - effing - owls,' muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I've got to go to a hearing,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"    'I won't give up hope, then,' said Uncle Vernon nastily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, if that's all,' said Harry, getting to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,' said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his temper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I told you - they suck all the happiness out of you,' said Harry, 'and if they get the chance, they kiss you - '    'Kiss you?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Of course they didn't get his soul, you'd know if they had,' said Harry, exasperated."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'You can't give a Dementor the old one-two,' said Harry through clenched teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache, something he hadn't been driven to do in a long time."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Couldn't tell you,' said Harry wearily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'It's you,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Of course I'm not,' said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He must have sent them,' said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Lord Voldemort,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'Lord - hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dully,No Entry,"that was the one who - '    'Murdered my parents, yes,' Harry said dully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'But he's gone,' said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He's back,' said Harry heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  'Hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Looks like it,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"  T see,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Uncle,Gryffindor,"said Uncle Vernon, bending forwards now, his massive purple face coming so close to Harry's, he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You can open it if you like,' said Harry, 'but I'll hear what it says anyway."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Come here,' said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Get going, then,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Fine,' said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'A stag,' said Harry nervously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  That's him, Mad-Eye,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Almost at once,' said Lupin, 'we're just waiting for the all-clear.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Not The Burrow, no,' said Lupin, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Yeah, I know,' said Harry uncomfortably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora,' muttered Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,' said Lupin, as though he had read Harry's mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'We're just waiting for the signal to tell us it's safe to set off,' said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Brooms,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kingsley,Hufflepuff,"    'Remus says you're a good flier,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'He's excellent,' said Lupin, who was checking his watch."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'I'll come and help you,' said Tonks brightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - ' said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Yeah, it does,' said Tonks decisively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Yeah,' said Tonks, looking proud."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Well, you'll have to learn the hard way, I'm afraid,' said Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh - yeah,' said Harry, grabbing a few more books."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'It's not very neat,' said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Ah, well,' said Tonks, slamming the trunk's lid shut, 'at least it's all in."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'And I'm still riding a Comet Two Sixty,' said Tonks enviously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Excellent,' said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Harry, I've left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry - '    They won't,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Nice one, Mad-Eye,' said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry's midriff."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he'll think we're not taking this seriously,' said Tonks, as she strapped Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage into a harness hanging from her broom."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kingsley,Hufflepuff,"'Our job's to deliver him safely to Headquarters and if we die in the attempt - '    'No one's going to die,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Think about what you've just memorised,' said Lupin quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"When we heard - and that Ministry hearing - it's just outrageous, I've looked it all up, they can't expel you, they just can't, there's provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations - '    'Let him breathe, Hermione,' said Ron, grinning as he closed the door behind Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'She's been in a right state,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know - '    'We wanted to give them to you, mate,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Hermione was going spare, she kept saying you'd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us - '    '- swear not to tell me,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'He seemed to think it was best,' said Hermione rather breathlessly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'He was so angry,' said Hermione, in an almost awestruck voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Maybe he thinks I can't be trusted,' said Harry, watching their expressions."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Don't be thick,' said Ron, looking highly disconcerted."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,' said Ron at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'It's a secret society,' said Hermione quickly 'Dumbledore's in charge, he founded it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Quite a few people - '    'We've met about twenty of them,' said Ron, 'but we think there are more.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Er,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We've told you, the Order don't let us in on their meetings,' said Hermione nervously 'So we don't know the details - but we've got a general idea,' she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry's face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know - '    'Some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order - ' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'And some of them are standing guard over something,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yeah,' said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We have,' said Hermione quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Hello, Harry' said George, beaming at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'You don't want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,' said Fred, also beaming."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'With distinction,' said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh-coloured string."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Time is Galleons, little brother,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'You want to be careful,' said Ron, staring at the Ear, 'if Mum sees one of them again ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Tonks told me how to find out,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Git,' said Fred idly    'He's on our side now,' said Hermione reprovingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Git,' said Fred idly    'He's on our side now,' said Hermione reprovingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Bill doesn't like him, either,' said Ginny, as though that settled the matter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"'She's got a job at Gringotts to eemprove 'er Eeenglish -    'And Bill's been giving her a lot of private lessons,' sniggered Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Charlie's in the Order, too,' said George, 'but he's still in Romania."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Whatever you do, don't mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,' Ron told Harry in a tense voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'It's been awful,' said Ginny sadly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'I think we're well shot of him,' said George, with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Percy and Dad had a row,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'It was the first week back after term ended,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, we were all surprised,' said George, 'because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    That's exactly what we wondered,' said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Only Dad wasn't,' said Fred grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody's having any contact with Dumbledore,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore's name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who's in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I know,' said Ron in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Mums been in a right state,' said Ron dully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But Percy must know Voldemort's back,' said Harry slowly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,' said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,' said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Not cover to cover,' said Harry defensively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'But I'd have seen - '    'Not if you've only been reading the front page, you wouldn't,' said Hermione, shaking her head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'It's quite nasty, actually,' said Hermione in a voice of forced calm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter's stories about him in a hurry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, they're writing about you as though you're this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he's a great tragic hero or something,' said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I know you don't,' said Hermione quickly, looking frightened."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"Don't I hey think I'd rather it'd never- '    'We know, Harry' said Ginny earnestly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'And of course, they didn't report a word about the Dementors attacking you,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Crookshanks,' said Ginny unblushingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, 'We knew you'd be angry, Harry, we really don't blame you, but you've got to understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore -    'Yeah, I know,' said Harry shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  The house-elf who lives here,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother,' said Ron irritably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, yeah,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Snape never eats here,' Ron told Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'My dear old mum, yeah,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"This was my parents' house,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'He tried,' said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Sit down, Harry' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  The meeting's over, Dung,' said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry, 'I haven't seen anyone.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No, it's been lousy,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the Headmaster."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Oh yeah,' said Sirius sarcastically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,' said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Sirius, surveying it with distaste."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bill,Gryffindor,"  'Let's eat,' said Bill quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'It looks wonderful, Molly,' said Lupin, ladling stew on to a plate lor her and handing it across the table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Whatever you like,' said Sirius indifferently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'I look forward to it,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bill,Gryffindor,"  They're not giving anything away yet,' said Bill."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'I think it depends what they're offered,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bill,Gryffindor,"    'He's feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,' said Bill, 'he hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know - '    A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus,' said Sirius in an undertone."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Not just yet, Molly,' said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  ' ""You're too young, you're not in the Order,"" ' said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother's."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing,' said Sirius calmly, 'that's your parents' decision."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I don't intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"'He's only fifteen and - '    'And he's dealt with as much as most in the Order,' said Sirius, 'and more than some.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,' said Sirius coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Personally,' said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, 'I think it better that Harry gets the facts - 'not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture - from us, rather than a garbled version from ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry's best interests at heart -'    'He's not your son,' said Sirius quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,' said Lupin sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,wailed Ginny    'NO!'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    That's because there haven't been any funny deaths yet,' said Sirius, 'not as far as we know, anyway ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'More than he thinks we do, anyway,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Or rather, you messed it up for him,' said Lupin, with a satisfied smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can't carry out his plans,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore's got a shrewd idea,' said Lupin, 'and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'We're doing our best,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bill,Gryffindor,"    'Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,' said Bill."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'Because of the Ministry's attitude,' said Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'Fudge is frightened of him, you see,' said Tonks sadly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Because accepting that Voldermort's back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn't had to cope with for nearly fourteen yea 's,' said Sirius bitterly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'You see the problem,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'And I'm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,' said Sirius, 'and it's very important    for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  They're trying to discredit him,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Bill,Gryffindor,"    'But Dumbledore says he doesn't care what they do as long as they don't take him off the Chocolate Frog Cards,' said Bill, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Voldemort doesn't march up to people's houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Asleep, yeah, right,' said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Sleep tight,' said Fred, winking."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Kreacher,' said Ron as he turned off the light."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"-demon,' said Harry firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Let slip, more like,' said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Could be anything,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Maybe it's something that can kill loads of people at once,' suggested George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Maybe it's some particularly painful way of killing people,' said Ron learfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He's got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,' said Harry, 'he doesn't need anything more efficient than that.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I hope it's our side,' said Ron, sounding slightly nervous."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'If it is, Dumbledore's probably keeping it,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Not necessarily,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Mum,' said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'She doesn't trust us at all, you know,' said Ron regretfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Kreachers really old, he probably couldn't manage - '    'You'd be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wnnts to, Hermione,' said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Well, Molly, I'm pretty sure this is a Boggart,' said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, 'but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out - knowing my mother, it could be something much worse.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'We want to experiment with Doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,' George told Harry under his breath."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"That's what we're putting in the adverts, anyway,' whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs Weasley's line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray Doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Us,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"George did the Fainting Fancies - we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat - '    'Mum thought we'd been duelling,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Well, we haven't had a chance to get premises yet,' said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack, 'so we're running it as a mail-order service at the moment."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'All thanks to you, mate,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Might be worth it,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,' said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs Weasley's voice to permeate the room better, 'it makes such a nice change.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    ' - COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE - '    The idiots are letting her get into her stride,' said George, shaking his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    This is Harry, Kreacher,' said Hermione tentatively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, 'he's not in his tight mind, he doesn't know what he's - '    'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it - '    'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Stand up straight,' said Sirius impatiently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"'Kreacher lives to serve lie Noble House of Black - '    'And it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"  'Master always liked his little joke,' said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, 'Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother's heart - '    'My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,' snapped Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"'Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was - '    'I asked you what you were up to,' said Sirius coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,' said the elf, then muttered very fast, 'Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it - '    'I thought it might be that,' said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, 'taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little - '    'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, 'maybe - '    'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order; said Sirius curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, 'taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little - '    'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, 'maybe - '    'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order; said Sirius curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, 'taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little - '    'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, 'maybe - '    'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order; said Sirius curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I used to be there,' said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'When I was about sixteen,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Your dad's place,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'He was younger than me,' said Sirius, 'and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But he died,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, no,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yeah, her mother Andromeda was my favourite col sin, said Sirius, examining the tapestry closely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'They're in Azkaban,' said Sirius shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch junior,' said Sirius, in the same brusque voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Sorry,' said Harry quickly, 'I didn't mean - I was just surprised, that's all - '    'It doesn't matter, don't apologise,' Sirius mumbled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    But if they do expel me,' said Harry quietly, 'can I come back here and live with you?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  They must be bad if you prefer this place,' said Sirius gloomily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'It means he gave them a load of gold,' said Sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'It was my father's,' said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Professor Dumbledore doesn't think it's a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I - '    ' - think he's quite right,' said Sirius through clenched teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'M - m - morning, Harry,' yawned Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Just - just toast, thanks,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,' said Tonks earnestly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Don't lose your temper,' said Sirius abruptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  The law's on your side,' said Lupin quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'OK,' said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'You'll be all right, Harry,' said Tonks, palling him on the arm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Good luck,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'And if it's not,' said Sirius grimly, 'I'll see to Amelia Bones for you ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Right,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    They're out of order,' said Harry, pointing at the sign."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry nervously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Mr Weasley,' said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, 'aren't we still underground?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kingsley,Hufflepuff,"  'Morning, Weasley,' said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kingsley,Hufflepuff,"  'Here,' said Kingsley brusquely to Mr Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Sorry,' said Harry nervously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'I must have missed it,' said Dumbledore cheerfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Not to worry, not to worry,' said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Harry, 'but - '    'Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry angrily, 'but I only used it because we were - '    The witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry, 'because - '    'A corporeal Patronus?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, 'it's a stag, it's always a stag.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry, 'I've been doing it for over a year.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"I want this dealt with quickly - '    'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, 'but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'I brought her with me,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"Even Bagman wouldn't have bet - '    'Oh, I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,' said Dumbledore lightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,' said Dumbledore calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    Then,' said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, 'we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of Dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,' said Dumbledore politely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Of course it isn't,' said Dumbledore mildly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Of course we are,' said Dumbledore, 'but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Of course you are,' said Dumbledore courteously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,' said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school, Harry's behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing,' said Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Of course they can,' said Dumbledore, inclining his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Excellent,' said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feel, pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I think so,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lucius,Slytherin,"Patronus Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry, 'yeah, I'm good at escaping.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,' said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Mr Weasley,' said Harry slowly, 'if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he's seeing them alone, how do we know they haven't put the Imperius Curse on him?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'They were bound to clear you,' said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes, 'there was no case against you, none at all.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering you all knew I'd get off,' said Harry, smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Absolutely,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,' said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to everyone's plates."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, he swung it for me,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'That's a bit harsh, Hermione,' said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger, 'you wouldn't want to be stuck inside this house without any company.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I don't think that's true,' said Harry, wringing out his cloth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'He just didn't want to get his own hopes up even more,' said Hermione wisely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No, I just think he's been very lonely for a long time,' said Hermione simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally    'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally    'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'And about time too,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, 'and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'One sacked, one dead, one's memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,' said Harry, counting them off on his fingers."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'No way,' said George in a hushed voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'There's been a mistake,' said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'I suppose all the mad stuff must've counted against him,' said George to Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Fred slowly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Ohh, Mum's going to be revolting,' groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"That's really - '    'Unexpected,' said George, nodding."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, 'no it's not ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Get him red and gold to match his badge,' said George, smirking."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'His badge,' said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'We've already bought him some,' said Fred sourly, who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Or a new cauldron, Charlie's old one's rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers -    'Mum,' said Ron hopefully, 'can I have a new broom?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'We could curtsey, if you like,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, shut up,' said Ron, scowling at them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,    'I'd love to see him try' sniggered George.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'We're going to have to watch our step, George,' said Fred, pretending to tremble, 'with these two on our case ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I don't think they are,' said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well done, Hermione,' said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, 'brilliant."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Thanks,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, no problem,' said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Ron, 'yeah, I suppose ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I thought we'd have a little party not a sit-down dinner,' she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny as they entered the room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'I was never a prefect myself,' said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Like the ability to behave myself,' said Tonks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'I think Dumbledore might have hoped I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    Oh - I dunno - ' said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Look what Dung's got us,' said George, holding out his hand to Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Venomous Tentacula seeds,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of Knarl quills,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins' outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'He'll have had his reasons,' replied Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry, once again attempting to grin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Molly' said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Don't be stupid,' said Harry, trying to smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Molly, that's enough,' said Lupin firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Don't worry about Percy,' said Sirius abruptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'And as for who's going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,' said Lupin, smiling slightly, 'what do you think we'd do, let them starve?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Mrs Weasley's patched her up,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I don't know, it's just what Mad-Eye says,' said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch, 'but if we don't leave soon we're definitely going to miss the train ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Thanks, Lee,' said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Well, look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'It's been great meeting all of you,' said Tonks, hugging Hermione and Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'He shouldn't have come with us,' said Hermione in a worried voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, lighten up,' said Ron, 'he hasn't seen daylight for months, poor bloke.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Fred, clapping his hands together, 'can't stand around chatting all day, we've got business to discuss with Lee."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Er,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I don't think we'll have to stay there all journey,' said Hermione quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Fine,' said Harry again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, definitely,' said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I know you're not,' said Harry and he grinned."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' said Harry, picking up Hedwig's cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Don't be silly,' said Ginny, laughing, 'she's all right.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"said Ginny, 'is it OK if we take these seats?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  Thanks,' said Ginny, smiling at her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Yes,' said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I know I am,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'I'm nobody,' said Neville hurriedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'No you're not,' said Ginny sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,' said Luna in a singsong voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Neville's grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Neville."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'It's really, really rare,' said Neville, beaming."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"hi,' said Harry blankly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Never mind,' said Ginny bracingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I'm starving,' said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,' said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Malfoy,' replied Harry at once, certain his worst fear would be confirmed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Course,' said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,' said Hermione viciously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,' said Ron thickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'We're supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,' he told Harry and Neville, 'and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, right, because Malfoy won't abuse it at all,' said Ron sarcastically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'For heavens sake, Ron - '    'I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing,' said Ron happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Excuse me,' said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I - oh,' said Hermione, looking embarrassed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"I mean, it's quite    'I'll have it back, thank you,' said Luna coldly, and leaning forwards she snatched it out of Harry's hands."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Shut up, Malfoy,' said Hermione sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'I seem to have touched a nerve,' said Malfoy, smirking."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Chuck us another Frog,' said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'We'd better change,' said Hermione at last, and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'I'll carry that owl, if you like,' said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh - er - thanks,' said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig's more securely into his arms."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'I don't know,' said Ginny, 'but we'd better get out of the way, we're blocking the door.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  That Luna girl was carrying him,' said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"I dunno,' said Ron, sounding worried."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Ginny's got him,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks,    Thanks,' said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"he's all right,' said Ron gruffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Oh, yes,' said Luna, 'I've been able to see them ever since my first day here."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'I'll be quite glad if he has,' said Luna, 'he isn't a very good teacher, is he?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Well, we in Ravenclaw think he's a bit of a joke,' said Luna, unfazed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"yeah,' said Harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'He can't have left,' said Ron, sounding slightly anxious."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Of course he hasn't,' said Harry firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"yeah, that'll be it,' said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid's absence."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Nice cardigan,' said Ron, smirking."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Too right it has,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'To our newcomers,' said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, 'welcome!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Excellent,' said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, yes,' said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"    'Well, now, you shouldn't take that attitude,' said Nick reprovingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Only because you're terrified of him,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, forget it,' said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, it certainly was illuminating,' said Hermione in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I said illuminating, not enjoyable,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I'll tell you what it means,' said Hermione through gritted teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Oh yeah,' said Ron, who had obviously forgotten."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dully,No Entry,"  'See you later,' he said dully to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring and pointing as he passed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"  'Hey, Harry,' said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Not bad,' muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, it was OK,' chuckled Dean."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Seamus,Gryffindor,"  Well,' said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry's eye, she ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'll talk to you how I want,' said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'That's out of order, Seamus,' said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red - always a danger sign."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Seamus,Gryffindor,"  'Then you're mad, too,' said Seamus in disgust."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"  'My parents are Muggles, mate,' said Dean, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"We believe Harry,' said Neville simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room,for simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs.(We regret that all work is undertaken at applicant's own risk.)'They are the limit,' said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend, which was to be in October."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Seamus reckons Harry's lying about You-Know-Who,' said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Hermione calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I listen, Ron,' said Hermione, with a touch of asperity."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"And the Sorting Hat's warning was the same: stand together, be united - '    'And Harry got it right last night,' retorted Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, I think it's a pity we're not trying for a bit of inter-house unity,' said Hermione crossly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,' said Harry sarcastically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Nice one,' said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina's pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood's had been, which could only be an improvement."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'OK,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I'd forgotten Wood had left,' said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I s'pose,' said Harry, taking the bench opposite."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl's leg and it took off again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'It's best to know what the enemy is saying,' said Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Look what we've got today,' said Ron grumpily, shoving his timetable under Fred's nose."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Fair point, little bro,' said Fred, scanning the column."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Because you'll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven't got an antidote yet,' said George, helping himself to a kipper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Cheers,' said Ron moodily, pocketing his timetable, 'but I think I'll take the lessons.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,' said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, 'you can't advertise for testers on the Gryffindor noticeboard.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Says me,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Leave me out of it,' said Ron hastily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'You'll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,' said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Fifth year's OWL year,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"They'll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they'll be rubbed raw,' said Fred with satisfaction."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to OWLs,' said George happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  That's 'cause you put Bulbadox powder in his pyjamas,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Oh yeah,' said Fred, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Anyway, it's a nightmare of a year, the fifth,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Yep,' said Fred unconcernedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,' said George brightly, 'now that we've got-    He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    We're not going to waste our last year here, though,' said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'You know, I've been wondering about that,' said Ron, his brow furrowed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, yeah,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Not really,' said Ron slowly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  Well, it'd be cool to be an Auror,' said Ron in an off-hand voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, it would,' said Harry fervently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'But they're, like, the elite,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, it is, but it's not the only worthwhile thing,' said Hermione thoughtfully, 'I mean, if I could take SPEW further ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'We'd fail our OWL, said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'We do try,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, don't give me that rubbish,' said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hi,' said Harry, feeling his face grow hot."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"    'Yeah, I do,' said Cho."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'I've supported them since I was six,' said Cho coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It means they're not real fans, they're just jumping on the bandwagon - '    That's the bell,' said Harry dully, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Settle down,' said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Before we begin today's lesson,' said Snape, sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all, 'I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,' said Snape softly, 'so, whether or not you are intending to attempt NEWT, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level I have come to expect from my OWL students."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,' called Snape, with ten minutes left to go."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'The Draught of Peace,' said Harry tensely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Tell me, Potter,' said Snape softly, 'can you read?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, I can,' said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry very quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry, more loudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,' said Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  That was really unfair,' said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd's pie."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well,' said Harry, glowering at his plate, 'since when has Snape ever been fair to me?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I did think he might be a bit better this year,' said Hermione in a disappointed voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Poisonous toadstools don't change their spots,' said Ron sagely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, shut up, the pair of you,' said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I'm not - '    'I'm just passing on the message,' said Ron, talking over him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'I never said it - '    'Good-day,' said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off, again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I never remember my dreams,' said Ron, 'you say one.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'You must remember one of them,' said Harry impatiently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,' said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Probably that you're going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,' said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Tut, tut,' said Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  There, now,' said Professor Umbridge sweetly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'I think we'll try that again,' said Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Good,' said Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Not about the chapter, no,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Well, we're reading just now,' said Professor Umbridge, showing her small pointed teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I've got a query about your course aims,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione Granger,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully' said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I don't,' said Hermione bluntly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Weasley,' said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'I repeat,' said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, 'do you expect to be attacked during my classes?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,' said Professor Umbridge dismissively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead - '    'He wasn't dead,' said Harry angrily, 'but yeah, he's returned!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Mr-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,' said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'It was murder,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,' said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I've been sent to see you,' said Harry stiffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'No, I couldn't,' said Professor McGonagall flatly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort's name)."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No, thanks,' said Harry coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'What I don't get,' said Harry through clenched teeth, laying down his knife and fork (his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady), 'is why they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told them ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    The thing is, Harry, I'm not sure they did,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Look, you don't understand what it was like after it happened,' said Hermione quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Mimbulus mimbletonia,' said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'And she's trying to get people to spy for her,' said Ron darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Don't start arguing again,' said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth to retaliate."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, you're right,' said George, nodding, 'this dosage looks strong enough, doesn't it?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Rubbish,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, look, they're coming round now,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Excellent,' said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"said Fred, in an I'd-like-to-see-you-try-it voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'You wouldn't,' said George, horrified, taking a step back from her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yes, I would,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag on to her back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  That's not on,' said Ron angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'But on the plus side, no Snape today,' said Ron bracingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'You cannot pass an OWL,' said Professor McGonagall grimly, 'without serious application, practice and study."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"'Yes, you too, Longbottom,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Bowtruckles,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Five points for Gryffindor,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Woodlice,' said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Never you mind,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class, too."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'Maybe,' said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him, 'the stupid great oaf's got himself badly injured.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Maybe you will if you don't shut up,' said Harry out of the side of his mouth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,' said Hermione at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that's all,' said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I wasn't going to,' said Hermione calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Because she'll never be as good as Hagrid,' said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - right,' said Harry awkwardly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, for heaven's sake, Harry, you can do better than her,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.'    'Er - thanks very much, Ernie,' said Harry, taken aback but pleased."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"    'Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en Friday,' said Angelina fiercely, 'and I don't care how you do it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Less than zero,' said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing,' said Ron at once, his ears reddening."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Er,' said Harry, without moving."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Oh, no,' said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'There,' said Umbridge sweetly, 'we're getting better at controlling our temper already, aren't we?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,' said Umbridge sweetly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Oh, you won't need ink,' said Professor Umbridge, with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Nothing,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Nope,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'At least it's only lines,' said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I can't believe how much homework we've got,' said Ron miserably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"I fancied a walk,' said Ron shiftily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Oh yes,' said Professor Umbridge, smiling as widely as before."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I'm - I'm hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'm not laughing,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I'm not bad,' said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry's reaction."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I wish I was going to be there,' said Harry bitterly, as they set off together towards the common room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge's office."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I don't know how much power McGonagall's got over her,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry flatly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He's got enough on his mind,' said Harry, but that was not the true reason."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'You know what to do, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'She's there,' said Fred, who was also swigging Butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,' said Ron, looking slightly put out."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Let her sleep,' said George hastily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Great,' said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Harry, dropping his voice, 'it's a possibility, isn't it?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I suppose so,' said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'She's evil,' said Harry flatly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"It's been hurting on and off all summer - it was just a bit worse tonight, that's all - '    'Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this - '    'Yeah,' said Harry, before he could stop himself, 'that's the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn't it, my scar?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh no,' said Hermione, looking relieved, 'if you're going that means I can go too, without being rude."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, bye,' said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Safe flight, then,' said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hi,' said Harry automatically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Right,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Yeah,' said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, 'I think so."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Gone,' said Harry calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"    'Because - '    'I saw him send it,' said Cho angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  No problem,' said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl's other leg, her face slightly pink."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Quidditch later,' said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, OK,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Look, I don't think you should,' said Hermione seriously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Wait a moment,' said Hermione suddenly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Lucius Malfoy, I'll bet anything,' said Harry in a low, furious voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I've got all the robes I want,' said Ron 'No,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I've got all the robes I want,' said Ron 'No,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"He's one of the Ord-    'Ron, shhl' said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, maybe they didn't expect him to get caught,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I mean, we can do it tonight,' said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, and with Hermione's dire warnings that they would fail all their OWLs still ringing in their ears."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, I do,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, that's right,' said Ron, in a heartened tone."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  Yeah,' said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Shut up,' said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the first time."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'OK, everyone,' said Angelina, entering from the Captain's office, already changed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"    'Exactly the attitude I want, Harry' said Angelina approvingly soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Pass it on, Ron,' called Angelina, as though nothing had happened."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Come on now, Ron,' said Angelina crossly, as he dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"    'All right,' called Angelina, 'Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He's just nervous,' said Harry, 'he was fine when I was practising with him this morning.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well, I hope he hasn't peaked too soon,' said Fred gloomily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Well, let's try again,' said Angelina."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'She needs the hospital wing,' said Angelina."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'We'll take her,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"'She - er - might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake - '    'Well, there's no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,' said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Completely lousy,' said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No one,' said Hermione, looking taken aback, 'I thought - '    'You thought I was bound to be rubbish?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Look, you said it was lousy so I just - '    'I'm going to get started on some homework,' said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys' dormitories and vanished from sight."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    No,' said Harry loyally."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Ron shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    Thanks,' snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"That's definitely Percy's handwriting,' said Ron, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Give it back,' said Ron, holding out his hand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Ah, Hermione, you're a life-saver,' said Ron, 'what can I - ?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Thanks a million, Hermione,' said Harry weakly, passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met,' said Ron weakly, 'and if I'm ever rude to you again - '    - I'll know you're back to normal,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met,' said Ron weakly, 'and if I'm ever rude to you again - '    - I'll know you're back to normal,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Because I've just seen Sirius's head in the fire,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'You sound like Molly,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I forgot,' said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'No, it was very good,' said Sirius, smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,' said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione's winces."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Well, now he's back it's bound to hurt more often,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I doubt it,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'I know her by reputation and I'm sure she's no Death Eater - '    'She's foul enough to be one,' said Harry darkly, and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, but the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters,' said Sirius with a wry smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Sirius, 'but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago thai makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Scared of them, I expect,' said Sirius, smiling at her indignation."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry, ignoring Hermione's affronted look at being cut off in her defence of Kreacher."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'All we do is read the stupid textbook,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Ah, well, that figures,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    That's exactly what he thinks you're doing,' said Sirius, 'or, rather, that's exactly what he's afraid Dumbledore's doing - forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Yep,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,    This reminded Harry of Percy's letter.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"Ron's brother Percy reckons there will be - '    'I don't know,' said Sirius, 'I haven't seer, anyone from the Order all weekend, they're all busy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"said Sirius, 'well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one's sure what's happened to him.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Listen, don't go asking too many questions about Hagrid,' said Sirius hastily, 'it'll just draw even more attention to the fact that he's not back and I know Dumbledore doesn't want that."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, that,' said Sirius, grinning, 'they're always guessing where I am, they haven't really got a clue - '    'Yeah, but we think this time they have,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, that,' said Sirius, grinning, 'they're always guessing where I am, they haven't really got a clue - '    'Yeah, but we think this time they have,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"If Malfoy recognises you again - '    'All right, all right, I've got the point,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Look - '    'Well, I'd better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,' said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Junior,Slytherin,"  ' ""The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,"" said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  ' ""That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,"" said Weasley last night."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Wait, there's more,' said Hermione grimly.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Weasley,Gryffindor,"  ' ""This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at Hogwarts,"" said Weasley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I know it is,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,' said Ron happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, come on,' said Hermione, jumping up, 'we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your OWL,' said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd got an ""O"" - '    'Hermione,' said Ron sharply, 'if you want to know what grades we got, ask.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I don't - I didn't mean - well, if you want to tell me - '    'I got a ""P"",' said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,' said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'But,' said Hermione, 'doesn't ""P"" stand for ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"    '""Poor"", yeah,' said Lee Jordan."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Yep,' said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    '""Troll"",' said George promptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Hermione at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Just now, before lunch,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,' said George, 'he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,' said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  Think of a dream, quick,' he told Ron, 'in case the old toad comes our way.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Now,' said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, 'you've been in this post how long, exactly?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Quite a period,' said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    That's right,' said Professor Trelawney shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Yes,' said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    These things often skip - er - three generations,' said Professor Trelawney."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'I'd like you to make a prediction for me,' said Professor Umbridge very clearly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'I see,' said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I've already read Chapter Two,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,' said Hermione promptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, I do,' said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  That is enough,' said Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,' said Professor Umbridge smoothly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence, but as none of them - with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects - would have passed a Ministry inspection - '    'Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,' said Harry loudly, 'there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"Then -    'I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge sleekly.*The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and, by the following morning, it was bleeding again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'From Professor Umbridge,' muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I know, mate,' said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon on to Harry's plate, 'she's bang out of order.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Excellent,' whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"'Mr Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework - Miss Brown, please take this box of mice - don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you - and hand one to each student - '    'Hem, hem,' said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"Today, we shall be - '    'Hem, hem,' said Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec - '    'Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,' said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'I wonder,' said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, 'how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, it's a start,' said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  Thirty-nine years this December,' said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'I can hardly wait,' said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off towards the door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Quite correct,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Hmm,' said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  ' 'Fraid I can't,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Yes, please do,' said Professor Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Overall,' said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, 'how do you, as a temporary member of staff- an objective outsider,    I suppose you might say - how do you find Hogwarts?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in OWL,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,' said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,' said Harry angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Jolly good,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.*It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I still reckon you should complain about this,' said Ron in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry flatly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'McGonagall would go nuts if she knew - '    'Yeah, she probably would,' said Harry dully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I suggested poison,' said Ron grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any Defence from her at all,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Hermione tentatively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well - learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Come off it,' groaned Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Don't be silly, of course there is,' said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"If we don't learn anything for a whole year - '    'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron in a defeated voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose - '    'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'But I'm not a teacher, I can't - '    'Harry, you're the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'No I'm rot, you've beaten me in every test - '    'Actually I haven't,' said Hermione coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But that was luck,' said Harry, 'it wasn't skill - '    'Second year,' Ron interrupted, 'you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up, I - '    Third year,' said Ron, louder still, 'you fought off about a hundred Dementors at once - '    'You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't - '    'Last year,' Ron said, almost shouting now, 'you fought off You-know-Who again - '    'Listen to me!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"The whole time you're sure you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own - your own brain or guts or whatever - 'like you can think straight when you know you're about a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die - 'they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that - and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up - you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me -'    'We weren't saying anything like that, mate,' said Ron, looking aghast."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"think about it,' said Hermione quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Course I have,' said Harry grumpily, 'can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us - '    'I meant the idea Ron and I had - ' Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I dunno,' said Harry, playing for time."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I thought it was a good idea from the start,' said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, 'but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said - '    Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Ho ho,' said Hermione in a bored voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'I can have a pen-pal if I - '    'He didn't only want to be your pen-pal,' said Ron accusingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,' said Hermione seriously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Because,' said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, 'I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about,' said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh - no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 'no, it's always packed and really noisy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry drily, 'especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Three Butterbeers, please,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'll get them,' said Harry quickly, passing over the silver."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"I've always wanted to try Firewhisky - '    'You - are - a - prefect,' snarled Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Ron, the smile fading from his face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Anthony,#N/A,"  First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Anthony,#N/A,"well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Of course I do,' said Hermione at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"that's the plan, anyway,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '    'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '    'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'So,' said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry slightly defensively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Mum told Ron not to spread it around,' said Fred, grinning at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Mum told Ron not to spread it around,' said Fred, grinning at Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'She's not wrong,' mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - yeah, I did, yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, 'he saved that Philological Stone - '    'Philosopher's,' hissed Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, 'he saved that Philological Stone - '    'Philosopher's,' hissed Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'And that's not to mention,' said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) 'all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year - getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Michael,Ravenclaw,"    'Not with the dragon, you didn't,' said Michael Corner at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well - ' said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Susan,#N/A,"  'And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry, 'no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is - '    'Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Here's an idea,' said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, 'why don't you shut your mouth?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  That's not what he said,' snarled Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, well, said Hermione hastily, moving on ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Right,' said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week - '    'Hang on,' said Angelina, 'we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"    'No,' said Cho, 'nor with ours.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,' said Hermione, slightly impatiently, 'but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters - '    'Well said!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells - '    'We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione, 'is that she's got some ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Yes, he's got an army of Heliopaths,' said Luna solemnly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Yes, he has,' said Luna."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, 'great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of - '    They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, 'great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of - '    They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"Just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you - '    'Hem, hem,' said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Hermione at once, 'yes, we were, you're right, Ginny.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"    Well, once a week sounds cool,' said Lee Jordan."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,' said Hermione in a tense voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Ron, 'McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Tri wizard.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"  'I - yes,' said Ernie, 'yes, I do believe that, it's just - '    'Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"No, of course not,' said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Well, time's ticking on,' said Fred briskly, getting to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I think that went quite well,' said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Michael,Ravenclaw,"    'Well, that's why he and his friends came, I think - well, they're obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael what was going on - '    'When did this - when did she -?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,' said Hermione composedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  The dark one,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I didn't like him,' said Ron at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Big surprise,' said Hermione under her breath."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'But, said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, 'I thought Ginny fancied Harry!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Exactly,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Hermione, smiling slightly, 'she just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'She can't,' said Ron at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Let's go and tell her,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Er - I don't think we're allowed in the girls' dormitories,' said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Me,' said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, it's an old-fashioned rule,' said Hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, 'but it says in Hogwarts: A History, that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'They can't have done,' said Hermione in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You're so naive,' said Ron, 'you think just because you're all honourable and trustworthy - '    'No, they can't have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You're so naive,' said Ron, 'you think just because you're all honourable and trustworthy - '    'No, they can't have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"'Believe me, if anyone's run off and told Umbridge, we'll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, put it this way,' said Hermione, 'it'll make Eloise Midgeon's acne look like a couple of cute freckles."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Knew you'd say that,' said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Of course,' said Hermione coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Here come Ernie and Hannah Abbott,' said Ron, looking over his shoulder."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'I'll tell Michael,' said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her bench, 'the fool, honestly ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'It's OK,' said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'No way,' said Ron, appalled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'OK, OK,' said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,' said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns's lesson."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Professor Binns,' said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Not at all well,' said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Yes,' said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    This is urgent,' said Harry curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, 'she turned up after the other post owls and her wing's all funny, look - '    Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Hmm,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - right - thanks,' said Harry, just as the bell rang for break."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'No problem,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staff room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig's leg."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I - ' said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the    corridor was almost upon him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'To Grubbly-Plank,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Snuffles,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Obviously,' said Hermione, also reading the note."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But it was still sealed and everything,' said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    T don't know,' said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, 'it wouldn't be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction, 'if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'What in the name of Merlin,' said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, 'was that about?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'You will notice,' said Snape, in his low, sneering voice, 'that we have a guest with us today.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Yes,' said Snape quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'Yes,' said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I suggest you ask him,' said Snape jerkily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Oh, I shall,' said Professor Umbridge, with a sweet smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Oh yes,' said Professor Umbridge, 'yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers' - er - backgrounds.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'No marks again, then, Potter,' said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry's cauldron with a wave of his wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry furiously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You can't skive off Divination,' said Hermione severely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I don't hate her,' said Hermione loftily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hysterical, 'you know what to do!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Parvati,Gryffindor,"  'Professor,' said Parvati, 'do you mean ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You and Umbridge have got something in common,' Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defence Against the Dark Arts."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"There will be - '    ' - no need to talk,' Harry, Ron and Hermione said together, under their breaths.*'No Quidditch practice,' said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the common room after dinner that night."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"'I didn't say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I - '    'I know, I know, said Angelina miserably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Hermione, 'look on the bright side - at least now you'll have time to do Snape's essay!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I can't, they're not technically doing anything wrong,' said Hermione through gritted teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You know, I don't get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each,' said Harry, watching as Fred, George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, they only know flashy stuff that's of no real use to anyone,' said Hermione disparagingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Not that good,' said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,' said Sirius, grinning still more broadly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"That's always packed with people - '    'Which means you'd have been harder to overhear,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Mundungus, of course,' said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, you are,' said Sirius, 'and just as well, isn't it, if the first thing you're going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'He was banned from the Hog's Head twenty years ago,' said Sirius, 'and that barman's got a long memory."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hear, hear,' said Harry and Ron enthusiastically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'So,' said Sirius, 'how are you organising this group?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well, mats a bit of a problem now, said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius's head turning in the flames."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, Sirius, it's just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school,' said Hermione, 'and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you'd wanted to."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn't need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee - '    'Fair point,' said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Fred and George told me it's blocked,' said Harry, shaking his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I'm almost certain of it,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It was a very, very close call last night,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry's frog, which deflated silently before them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I don't reckon he'll risk it again,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It's the way you're moving your wand,' said Hermione, watching Ron critically, 'you don't want to wave it, it's more a sharp jab.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Ravens are harder than frogs,' said Ron through clenched teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Fine, let's swap,' said Hermione, seizing Ron's raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"said Professor Flitwick's squeaky little voice, making Harry, Ron and Hermione all jump."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Oh - oh, right,' said Ron, very flustered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Angelina, beaming."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, that clears that up,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I know,' said Hermione, twisting her fingers together."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But he's all for it,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Hermione, staring at the window again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Let's get this straight,' said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, 'Sirius agrees with us, so you don't think we should do it any more?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Well, yeah,' said Fred, 'your temperature'll go right up.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'But you get these massive pus-filled boils, too,' said George, 'and we haven't worked out how to get rid of them yet.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I can't see any boils,' said Ron, staring at the twins."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'No, well, you wouldn't,' said Fred darkly, 'they're not in a place we generally display to the public.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"    'But they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the - '    'All right, everyone, listen up,' said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captain's office."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione did it,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"    'I think we all ought to try that,' said Angelina."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'All right, on my whistle,' shouted Angelina."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'I think a few of mine have ruptured,' said Fred in a hollow voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Mine haven't,' said George, through clenched teeth, 'they're throbbing like mad ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'm not making prophecies,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry, shaking his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You've got to tell someone,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,  'I told Sirius last time.'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I've just told you, he already knows,' said Harry shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, stroking Hedwig's head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"    'Oh, no, sir,' said Dobby happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Not really bad,' said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Wait a moment - there is something you can do for me, Dobby,' said Harry slowly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"  'Because it is a room that a person can only enter,' said Dobby seriously, 'when they have real need of it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"and Dobby knows Mr Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and - '    'And if you really needed a bathroom,' said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, 'would it fill itself with chamber pots?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"    'Dobby expects so, sir,' said Dobby, nodding earnestly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It sounds brilliant,' said Harry, his heart racing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dobby,No Entry,"    'Any time, Harry Potter, sir,' said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry's enthusiasm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Not tonight, Dobby,' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Good,' said Harry quietly, when she."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Just in passing,' said Harry, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, well, that's all right then,' said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Filch is on the second floor,' said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes, 'and Mrs Norris is on the fourth.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'In her office,' said Harry, pointing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'OK,' said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  These will be good when we're practising Stunning,' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"  'Whoa,' said Dean, staring around, impressed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Harry, slightly nervously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'It's bizarre,' said Fred, frowning around at it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Dark detectors,' said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I think we ought to elect a leader,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Harry's leader,' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,' said Hermione, unperturbed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Er - right, thanks,' said Harry, who could feel his face burning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I was thinking,' said Hermione, frowning at Fred, 'more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, the DA's good,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters:DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY'Right,' said Harry, when she had sat down again, 'shall we get practising then?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I've used it against him,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'OK,' said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him, 'I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Sorry Harry,' said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  That wasn't bad,' said Harry, 'but there's definite room for improvement.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Oh no,' said Cho rather wildly as he approached."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  Well, they've forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge, too,' said Cho, drawing herself up proudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch - 'Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, that was pretty good,' said Harry, 'but we've overrun, we'd better leave it here."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Let's say next Wednesday night, then,' said Harry, 'we can decide on additional meetings then."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  That was really, really good, Harry,' said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Only once,' said Hermione, stung."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Terry,Ravenclaw,"said Terry Boot    'Yes,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"said Terry Boot    'Yes,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Hermione, trying to look modest."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,' said Hermione brightly, 'but it decided on Gryffindor in the end."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"yes,' said Hermione quietly, 'that is where I got the idea ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"I prefer your way,' said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his; Galleon into his pocket."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Fat chance,' said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air, 'I haven't got any real Galleons to confuse it with.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they came within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time, too."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Don't be thick,' said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals, 'you're going to be fine."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Get a grip,' said Harry sternly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, 'a few more accidents like that and the game's in the bag, isn't it?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He's just nervous,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, that's a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you're not a bit nervous,' said Hermione heartily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'I'm supporting Gryffindor,' said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at her hat."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Good luck, Ron,' said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'OK, I've only just found out the final line-up for Slytherin,' said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Crabbe,Slytherin,"They're two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don't know much about them - '    'We do,' said Harry and Ron together."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"They're two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don't know much about them - '    'We do,' said Harry and Ron together."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Well, they don't look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other,' said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, 'but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way on to the pitch without signposts.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'It's time,' said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"' - and Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell tanking up the pitch - ' cried Lee valiantly, though the singing was now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"' - and it's Warrington again,' bellowed Lee, 'who passes to Pucey, Pucey's off past Spinnet, come on now, Angelina, you can take him - turns out you can't - but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley I mean, George Weasley, oh, who cares, one of them, anyway, and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell - er - drops it, too - so that's Montague with the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle and he's off up the pitch, come on now, Gryffindor, block him!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'It was that thug Crabbe,' said Angelina angrily, 'he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you'd got the Snitch - but we won, Harry, we won!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"'But we couldn't find rhymes for fat and ugly - we wanted to sing about his mother, see - '    Talk about sour grapes,' said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted look."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'Or perhaps,' said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, 'you can remember what your mother's house stank like, Potter, and Weasley's pigsty reminds you of it - '    Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Malfoy provoked us,' said Harry stiffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two - '    'He insulted my parents,' snarled George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'I think they deserve rather more than detentions,' said Umbridge, smiling still more broadly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Well, yes,' said Umbridge, still smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Yes, Mr Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,' said Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"    And with a look of the utmost satisfaction, Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in her wake.*'Banned,' said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the common room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Alicia,Gryffindor,"  'Its just so unfair,' said Alicia numbly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'It's not my fault I didn't,' said Fred, with a very ugly look on his face, 'I would've pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn't been holding me back.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'I'm going to bed,' said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I think he's avoiding us,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You look frozen,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'For thinking I can play Quidditch,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'If you resign,' said Harry testily, 'there'll only be three players left on the team.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  This is all my fault - '    'You didn't make me punch Malfoy,' said Harry angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Join the club,' said Harry bitterly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  Told yeh, nuthin',' said Hagrid firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Come off it,' said Ron, 'you're in a right state!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,' said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,' said Hermione anxiously, 'some of those cuts look nasty.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face, 'who said anythin' abou' giants?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We guessed,' said Hermione apologetically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"obvious,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well, they're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest, said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Mountains,' said Hagrid unhelpfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    They do,' said Hagrid darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, tha's righ',' said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Well, Durnbledore knew, an' he told us,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Not really,' said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Yeh don' understand,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with 'im, an' - '    'We know about that,' said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story, 'we know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore - '    'So you couldn't use magic to get there?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Well, not exactly all the way' said Hagrid cagily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Found 'em,' said Hagrid baldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  ""Bout twenty feet,' said Hagrid casually."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yep,' said Hagrid sadly, 'eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'So,' said Harry, 'you saw them and then what?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Well, we waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on 'em in the dark, fer our own safety' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'It was def'nitely on some o' their minds,' said Hagrid, shrugging, 'but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Everlasting fire,' said Hermione irritably, 'you ought to know that by now."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Well, anyway,' said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, 'Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies it down in the snow by Karkuss feet and says, ""A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings."""
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Nothin',' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Didn' matter,' said Hagrid imperturbably, 'Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,' said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Not much,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,' said Hagrid sadly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Karkus's,' said Hagrid heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Course we did,' said Hagrid, 'we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Blimey, Hagrid,' said Ron quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Hagrid, 'I wish he had.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Course we did,' said Hagrid, 'we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Blimey, Hagrid,' said Ron quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Hagrid, 'I wish he had.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yep,' said Hagrid darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at 'em,' said Hagrid, the corners of h s mouth lifting his wild beard, 'she was rarin' ter attack 'em ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Cave must've been cramped,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Wasn' room ter swing a Kneazle,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,' said Hagrid, 'but they was badly hurt, all three o' them; Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Nope,' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, 'but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I spect some o' them'll remember it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"I'm really sorry,' said Hermione in a very small voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Or why you're back so late,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Er - I don' want ter be rude,' said Hagrid, staring at her, 'but who the ruddy hell are you?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,' said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"'I am now the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher - '    Tha's brave of yeh,' said Hagrid, 'there's not many'd take tha' job any more.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    ' - and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,' said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Precisely what I was going to ask,' said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood hidden, 'oh, tha' was ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'I was talkin' ter Fang,' said Hagrid stoutly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"in a manner o' speakin',' said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"'I sometimes say Fang's near enough human - '    There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,' said Umbridge sleekly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I on'y jus' got back,' said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Hagrid, 'bit o' - o' fresh air, yeh know - '    'Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by' said Umbridge sweetly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Yeah,' said Hagrid, 'bit o' - o' fresh air, yeh know - '    'Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by' said Umbridge sweetly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"sensitive skin,' said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Righ',' said Hagrid, nodding."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Oh, yes; said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, pulling off the Cloak."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,' said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'I'm not sayin',' said Hagrid happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Look, Hagrid,' said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretence, 'Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I dunno if you got through to him,' said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  Then I'll go back again tomorrow,' said Hermione determinedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window, 'I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window - OUCH!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dully,No Entry,"    'Well, I tried,' she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Hermione miserably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Course they're trained,' said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"An' - '    'Excuse me,' said Malfoy in a sneering voice, 'but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    Thestrals,' said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft 'Oh!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"Professor Trelawney told me once - '    'No, no, no,' said Hagrid, chuckling, 'tha's jus' superstition, that is, they aren' unlucky, they're dead clever an' useful!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Don' worry, it won' hurt yeh,' said Hagrid patiently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Go on then,' said Hagrid, beaming at her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    Tha's exactly right,' said Hagrid solemnly, 'ten points ter Gryffindor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, yeah,' said Hagrid brightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"said Hagrid, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered, 'erm ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"memory,' muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yeah,' said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge's clipboard, but ploughing on valiantly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"violence,' muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"anyway,' said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson, 'so - Thestrals."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Do you find,' said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, 'that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"'Mazin' sense o' direction, jus' tell 'em where yeh want ter go - '    'Assuming they can understand you, of course,' said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"my grandad,' said Neville."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Erm,' said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"frightened,' muttered Umbridge, making another note on her clipboard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'It's quite all right,' said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Umbridge said they're dangerous,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, it's like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,' said Hermione impatiently, 'and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn't usually show them to us before NEWT level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren't they?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'It's OK,' he said quickly, 'don't worry'    'I'm surprised so many people could see them,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle ('You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,' said Ron), to watch over first- and second-years spending their break-times inside because of the bitter cold ('And they're cheeky little snot-rags, you know, we definitely weren't that rude when we were in first year, said Ron) and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels ('He's got dung for brains, that one,' said Ron furiously)."

Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry, 'it was Dobby the house-elf.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"'Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, 'we've finally replaced you.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Katie,Gryffindor,"  'Ginny Weasley,' said Katie."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Angelina,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, I know,' said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, 'but she's pretty good, actually."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Alicia,Gryffindor,"  'Andrew Kirke,' said Alicia without enthusiasm, 'and Jack Sloper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'We're all really sorry Harry didn't tell you, then,' said Fred loudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  ' - we can practise in pairs,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, well,' said Harry wearily, moving towards the door, 'I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it's nothing to be proud of.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'You're a r-really good teacher, you know,' said Cho, with a watery smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Thanks,' said Harry awkwardly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Mistletoe,' said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No idea,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Ron, his smile fading slightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Dunno,' said Harry, who hadn't considered this, and immediately felt rather worried."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Of course you're not,' said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her letter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,' said Hermione vaguely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'You'd think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,' said Ron, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Ron,' said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot, 'you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, slightly desperately, 'who does?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry and Ron together."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have,' said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'She was the one who started it,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'I wouldn't've - she just sort of came at me - and next thing she's crying all over me - I didn't know what to do - '    'Don't blame you, mate,' said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You just had to be nice to her,' said Hermione, looking up anxiously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, 'I sort of - patted her on the back a bit.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You know what I mean,' said Hermione impatiently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh well,' said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, 'you'll have plenty of opportunities to ask her.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Don t be silly, said Hermione vaguely, Harry's liked her lor ages, haven't you, Harry?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, night,' said Hermione, yawning widely as she set off up the girls' staircase."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Harry, considering the matter, 'I s'pose he's older, isn't he ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, but apart from that,' said Ron, sounding aggravated."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Bit grouchy, yeah,' said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Night,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cedric,Hufflepuff,"Cho shouted, 'Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog Cards, look!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Harry, mate,' said Ron uncertainly, 'you ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'I believe you, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Weasley, you ought to come too,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Fizzing Whizzbee,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"well, a nightmare,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It wasn't a nightmare,' said Harry quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"I don't know,' said Harry, rather angrily - what did it matter?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'Inside my head, I suppose - '    'You misunderstand me,' said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry emphatically - why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    The man has red hair and glasses,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Please sit down, all three of you,' said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken, 'Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Naturally, naturally,' murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"He doesn't look good, he's covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg's portrait to get a good view as they left - '    'Good,' said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Thank you,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"  'Oh, very well,' said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension, 'though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he's done away with most of the family - '    'Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,' said Dumbledore, and Harry realised immediately where he had heard Phineas's voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, very well,' said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension, 'though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he's done away with most of the family - '    'Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,' said Dumbledore, and Harry realised immediately where he had heard Phineas's voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt - '    'Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,' said Dumbledore, before Harry could speak."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Dumbledore, 'Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'It is Fawkes's warning,' said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"  'He says he'll be delighted,' said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"Thineas Nigellus said Arthur's been badly injured - '    'Ask Harry,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'She probably doesn't even know what's happened yet,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    We've got to go to St Mungos, said Ginny urgently, She looked around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pyjamas."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Course we can go to St Mungo's if we want,' said Fred, with a mulish expression."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'That's right,' said Sirius encouragingly, 'come on, lets all ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, forget it, then,' muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry impatiently 'but he didn't tell me what it meant."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'I'm sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,' said Sirius steadily    'But that's not all,' said Harry, in a voice only a little above a whisper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'm sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,' said Sirius steadily    'But that's not all,' said Harry, in a voice only a little above a whisper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  ""It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that's all,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and - '    'It wasn't that,' said Harry, shaking his head, 'it was like something rose up inside me, like there's a snake inside me.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'You need to sleep,' said Sirius firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'No,' said Tonks musingly, 'no, I suppose it's not really prophecy you're doing, is it?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'Right,' said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'You read my mind,' said Fred, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Not running away, no,' said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"  'I thought,' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, 'that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It's not my own neck I'm saving,' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"  'Oh, I see,' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, 'this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"    'I have just given it to you, dolt,' said Phineas Nigellus smoothly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"    'Nothing whatsoever,' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"    'You know,' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, 'this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Fine,' said Harry stiffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Merry Christmas,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Without a note,' added George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'No problem,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kreacher,No Entry,"In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, 'has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, 'but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid - '    'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, 'one more -    But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Er - we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, 'Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"yeah, we have,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Er,' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, 'actually, we were just - er -'    But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of 'going to have a cup of tea' trailed away into nothingness."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  This is our long-term residents' ward,' she informed Harry, Ron,    Hermione and Ginny in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - thanks,' said Harry, shaking hands."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Nor me,' whispered Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"In fact, if it hadn't been for the DA, Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Er,' said Harry, to announce his presence."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'You know,' said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, 'I think I'd prefer it if you didn't give orders here, Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, 'but Black - '    'I'm his godfather,' said Sirius, louder than ever."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, 'but Black - '    'I'm his godfather,' said Sirius, louder than ever."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, 'but by all means stay, Black, I know you like lo feel ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,' said Snape smoothly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,' said Snape silkily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Wait a moment,' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'I'll get to the point, then,' said Sirius, standing up."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, I have,' said Sirius proudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, 'I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better - '    'Oh, but why don't you tell him so?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'Speaking of dogs,' said Snape softly, 'did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Why, yes, I suppose I am,' said Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing, Arthur,' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'OK,' said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Let's go, then,' said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Right - yeah,' said Harry distractedly; it was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfathers face and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief, one-armed hug, and saying gruffly, 'Look after yourself, Harry.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,' said Tonks, and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said, 'Welcome to the - '    'Yes, yes, we know, thank you,' said Tonks swiftly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"    'If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,' muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forwards."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I've always wanted to go on this thing,' said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking around."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Looks like we'll have to split up,' said Tonks briskly, looking a.round for empty chairs."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Stan,No Entry,"  'Just outside Birmingham,' said Stan happily, answering Harry's unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a loud BANG.    'I've changed my mind,' muttered Ron, picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time, 'I never want to ride on this thing again.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Stan,No Entry,"    'Listen, it's 'Ogwarts stop after this,' said Stan brightly, swaying towards them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'You'll be safe once you're in the grounds,' said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, all right,' said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin's prematurely lined face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Forget it,' said Harry dismally."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We'll be in the library, Harry,' said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, not bad,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Mine was pretty quiet,' said Cho."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"that's settled then,' said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Right,' said Harry tersely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,' said Snape, his eyes narrowed malevolently, 'but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ""sir"" or ""Professor"" at all times.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"sir,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,said Harry looking directly into Snape's eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'You have no subtlety, Potter,' said Snape, his dark eyes glit-te'ing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,' said Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'Do not interrupt me, Potter,' said Snape in a dangerous voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I just wanted to know,' Harry began again, forcing his voice back to politeness, 'why - '    'You seem to have visited the snake's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,' snarled Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'It seems so,' said Snape coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'I told you,' said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, 'to call me ""sir""."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, sir,' said Harry impatiently, 'but how do you know - '?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'It is enough that we know,' said Snape repressively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'He might,' said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,' said Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I am about to attempt to break into your mind,' said Snape softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I thought not,' said Snape, watching him closely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Flashes of it,' said Snape, his lip curling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,' said Snape, raising his wand once more."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'm trying,' said Harry angrily, 'but you're not telling me how!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'Manners, Potter,' said Snape dangerously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I am not weak,' said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'And why,' said Snape slowly, 'would you ask such a thing?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Because,' said Harry, watching Snape's face closely, 'that corridor I've just seen - I've been dreaming about it for montns - I've just recognised it - it leads to the Department of Mysteries ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Fine,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry, who was barely listening."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'And be warned, Potter ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"I dunno,' said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot through his scar again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"whispered Ron, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly 'that the weapon - the thing You-Know-Who's after - is in the Ministry of Magic?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I know they call the people who work in there ""Unspeakables"",' said Ron, frowning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'It's not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    I expect anyone would feel snaky if they'd had their mind attacked over and over again,' said Hermione sympathetically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I think I'll go to bed,' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Something good's happened,' mumbled Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Hermione told me to come and check on you,' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"There you are, Harry,' said Ron, looking awestruck."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I don't believe this,' snarled Harry, 'Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh my - ' said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"horrible,' said Hermione, looking shaken."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  To send a letter,' said Hermione, swinging her bag on to her shoulder."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Fine, fine,' said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he w aved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  They obviously can't talk freely in the staff room any more,' said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Maybe it's a bit like an illness,' said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    The lessons with Snape are making it worse,' said Harry flatly 'I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'I just wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at it - '    That's not funny,' said Hermione sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind,' said Ron darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"make it easier for You-Know-    'Shut up, Ron,' said Hermione angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'He used to be a Death Eater,' said Ron stubbornly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"I dunno,' said Harry uncertainly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Well, bring her along if you must,' said Hermione urgently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    It's because you're good when you're on form, that's why,' said Harry irritably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Hi,' said Cho slightly breathlessly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hi,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' sighed Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry, grinning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"    'And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,' said Cho, smiling reminiscently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, 'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"yeah,' said Harry untruthfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  Two coffees, please,' said Cho."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'I came in here with Cedric last year,' said Cho."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, it's yeh, Harry,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,    'Er - ' said Harry.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"both outsiders, like,' said Hagrid, nodding wisely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"I s'pose,' said Harry cautiously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Family,' said Hagrid gloomily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid,' said Harry, unable to stop himself, 'where are you getting all these injuries?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, pointing at Hagrid's face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"tha's jus' normal bumps an' bruises, Harry,' said Hagrid c.ismissively 'I got a rough job.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rita,Slytherin,"  'Its none of your business if Harry's been with a hundred girls,' Eermione told Rita coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, I suppose you are,' said Hermione coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'One more word about Harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise,' said Hermione irritably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, yes, one of these days you'll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,' said Hermione indifferently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rita,Slytherin,"    They've run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,' said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, 'How has that made you feel, Harry?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'He feels angry, of course,' said Hermione in a hard, clear voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I wasn't the sole witness,' snarled Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rita,Slytherin,"    'I'd love them,' breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'As a matter of fact,' said Hermione sweetly, 'that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, I do,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rita,Slytherin,"    There's no market for a story like that,' said Rita coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them,' said Hermione irritably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,    The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,' she said coldly    'My dad thinks it's an awful paper,' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'No,' said Luna, dipping her onion back into her Gillywater, 'he's the editor of The Quibbler.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Some people won't,' said Hermione in a level voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'I don't think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,' said Luna dreamily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, yes,' said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Daddy will be pleased,' said Luna brightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I suppose,' said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Fire away, then, Rita,' said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"Seen and UnforseenLuna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, ' - and of course, that'll be a very important story, so Harry's might have to wait for the following issue,' said Luna."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"  'Can't wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,' said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'It's the right thing to do, Harry,' said Neville, who was sitting opposite him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' mumbled Harry, 'but people have got to know what Voldemort's capable of, haven't they?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    That's right,' said Neville, nodding, 'and his Death Eaters, too ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, I forgot to ask you,' said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, 'what happened on your date with Cho?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds, 'a complete fiasco, now you mention it.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Well, you see,' said Hermione, with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals iwo to an over-emotional toddler, 'you shouldn't have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But, but,' spluttered Harry, 'but - you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that w:."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You should have told her differently' said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'But I don't think you're ugly,' said Harry, bemused."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Girls don't often ask questions like that,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I'm not saying what she did was sensible,' said Hermione, as Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You should write a book,' Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, 'translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'It was a nightmare,' said Ron in a surly voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh come on,' said Hermione, looking at Ginny, 'I'm sure it wasn't that - '    'Yes, it was,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Oh come on,' said Hermione, looking at Ginny, 'I'm sure it wasn't that - '    'Yes, it was,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Come on, Ginny's not bad,' said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'She's been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren't looking,' said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said George, looking mildly impressed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Well, he can do it if he doesn't think anyone's watching him,' said Fred, rolling his eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Told you already, we're not fussed about NEWTs,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Kill him, more like,' said Fred firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'That's the trouble with Quidditch,' said Hermione absent-mindedly, once again bent over her Runes translation, 'it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione,' said Harry, shaking his head, 'you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'I haven't even got the heart to take the mickey out of him,' said Fred, looking over at Ron's crumpled figure."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Thais what I thought,' said Hermione eagerly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Help yourself,' said Harry, feeling slightly bemused."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'This one's from a bloke who thinks you're off your rocker,' said Ron, glancing down his letter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St Mungo's,' said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling up a second."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  This one looks OK, though,' said Harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    This one's in two minds,' said Fred, who had joined in the letter-opening with enthusiasm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Here's another one you've convinced, Harry!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Another one who thinks you're barking,' said Ron, throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder '."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Be careful, Mr Weasley or I shall have to put you in detention,' said Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'People have written to me because I gave an interview,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Last Hogsmeade weekend,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they bombarded me with questions,' Hermione told Harry, her eyes shining, 'and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Theodore,#N/A,"    If anything more was needed to complete Harry's happiness, it was the reaction he got from Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle, He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library; they were with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'And the best bit,' whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, 'is they can't contradict you, because they can't admit they've read the article!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I have been badly advised, it seems,' said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I do not blame you, Rookwood,' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Stand up, Rookwood,' whispered Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You have done well to tell me this,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Rookwood,#N/A,"yes, My Lord,' gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No - everyone's fine - ' gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it were on fire."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I was You-Know-Who,' said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Did you say,' murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry's on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table, 'that you were You-Know-Who?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Harry,' he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes and talking, 'you've got to tell - '    'I haven't got to tell anyone,' said Harry shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Sturgis Podmore - ' said Hermione breathlessly, 'arrested for trying to get through a door!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Voldemort,Slytherin,  'And now Rookwood's told Voldemort how to get the weapon?'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I didn't hear all the conversation, but that's what it sounded like,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You're supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,' said Hermione, suddenly stern."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I know I am,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'But - '    'Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,' said Hermione firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  That last memory,' said Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I don't know,' said Harry, getting wearily to his feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'No,' said Snape softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"nothing,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'It - ' said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, 'it was -just a dream I had.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry stiffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'So I can learn Occlumency, said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Perhaps,' said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, 'perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No, they don't,' said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  That is just as well, Potter,' said Snape coldly, 'because you a;-e neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Reparo,' hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'On the count of three, then,' said Snape, raising his wand once more."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"dunno what happened,' said Harry truthfully, standing up."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses, 'you c - can't sack me!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'It was your home,' said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, on to one of her trunks, 'until an hour ago, when the Minister for Magic: countersigned your Order of Dismissal."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"I sh - shall - leave Hogwarts and s - seek my fortune elsewhere - '    'No,' said Dumbledore sharply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"    'Of course,' said McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, that won't be a problem,' said Dumbledore pleasantly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Number Twenty-two - '    'The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if - and only if - the Headmaster is unable to find one,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  This is Firenze,' said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Not really,' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Either way, he's still got four legs,' said Hermione coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I've got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,' said Hermione darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Impossible,' said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You mark my words, she's going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,' said Hermione, closing the newspaper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Er - hi,' said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,' said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, 'in imitation of my natural habitat."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Parvati,Gryffindor,"    'Please - er - sir - ' said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand, - why not?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"    'It is not a question of your bravery,' said Firenze, 'but of my position."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,' said Firenze quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"    'Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,' said Firenze."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'Let us begin,' said Firenze."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"    'Lie back on the floor, said Firenze in his calm voice, and observe the heavens."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"'Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now - ' she drew a right-angle in the air above her '- that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things - '    'That,' said Firenze calmly, 'is human nonsense.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,' said Firenze, as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  ' - is a human,' said Firenze simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, 'Harry Potter, a word, please.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'And he would do better to abandon it,' said Firenze, nodding."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Firenze,No Entry,"  'Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,' said Firenze, 'and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"If you're doing anything you shouldn't be, you'll be - '    There's things more importan' than keepin' a job,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'Oh, don't be such a killjoy,' said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement C-Uring their last lesson before Easter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    They're not supposed to be pretty, they're supposed to protect you,' said Harry patiently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'I'm trying,' said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry, firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No, I don't,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Not that I'm aware of,' said Harry blandly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, it is,' said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'I think, Minister,' said Umbridge silkily from beside him, 'we might make better progress if I fetch our informant.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Nothing at all, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Don't be scared, dear, don't be frightened,' said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, 'it's quite all right, now."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Never mind the spots now, dear,' said Umbridge impatiently, 'just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister - '    But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,' said Umbridge smugly 'He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - '    'Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,' said Dumbledore softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  The purpose of Potters meeting with these students,' continued Professor Umbridge, 'was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age - '    'I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,' said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers, 'they certainly would be, if they had continued after the Decree came into effect."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Miss Edgecombe,' said Umbridge at once, 'tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,' said Professor McGonagall harshly, 'there have been no secret meetings for the past six months."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"    'Well, usually when a person shakes their head,' said McGonagall coldly, 'they mean ""no""."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,' said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he looked angry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Kingsley,Hufflepuff,"  'You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,' said Kingsley, in his deep, slow voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'No,' said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Dolores,' said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, 'the meeting tonight - the one we know definitely happened - '    'Yes,' said Umbridge, pulling herself together, 'yes ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Dumbledore's Army, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge's face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  That's right,' said Dumbledore pleasantly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'I did,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,' said Dumbledore, nodding."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  That's right,' said Dumbledore cheerfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,' said Dumbledore calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'Well, well, well - I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead - '    'Instead you get to arrest me,' said Dumbledore, smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Ah,' said Dumbledore gently, 'yes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    Well,' said Dumbledore apologetically, 'I'm afraid I do.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Don't be silly, Dawlish,' said Dumbledore kindly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Merlin's beard, no,' said Dumbledore, smiling, 'not unless you are foolish enough to force me to.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,' said Dumbledore in a low voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Oh no,' said Dumbledore, with a grim smile, 'I am not leaving to go into hiding."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Remember - close your mind - '    But as Dumbledore's fingers closed over Harry's skin, a pa n shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him - '    ' - you will understand,' whispered Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"  'Dumbledore will be back before long,' said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology, after listening intently to Harry's story."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head's office,' said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"  'It's only teachers who can dock points from houses, Malfoy,' said Ernie at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,' said Malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver 'I' on his robes just beneath his prefect's badge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'Wise move, Granger,' breathed Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"  'He was bluffing,' said Ernie, looking appalled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,' said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour-glass."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'He never managed to get all the words out,' said Fred, 'due to the fact that we forced him head-first into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him,' said Fred coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Course we have,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'We've always known where to draw the line,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  We might have put a toe across it occasionally,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'But we've always stopped short of causing real mayhem,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Well, now -' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,  ' - what with Dumbledore gone - ' said Fred.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,  ' - we reckon a bit of mayhem - ' said George.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  ' - is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,' said Fred."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'You'll see,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I think we should get out of here, you know,' said Hermione nervously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'Just in case    'Yeah, all right,' said Ron, and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed the day's ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose-to-nose with Filch the caretaker."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I didn't do it,' said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I've noticed,' said Harry coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Sit,' said Umbridge curtly, pointing towards a chair."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing, thank you,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"tea then,' said Harry shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No idea,' said Harry promptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, 'let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No idea,' said Harry loudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"shrieked Umbridge, 'they'll be all over the school unless we do something - Stupefy!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Cheers,' whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Dear, dear,' said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  Thanks,' said George, looking both surprised and pleased."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'It was worth it, though,' said Fred, who was taking orders from clamouring Gryffindors."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Now you mention it,' said Hermione happily, 'd'you know ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Over here,' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"    'Oh, no,' said Cho hurriedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well,' said Harry moodily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"  'She's a lovely person really,' said Cho."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Cho,Ravenclaw,"'And in case you hadn't noticed, he hasn't got sneak written across his face - '    That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Cho fiercely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list - '    'I think it was a brilliant idea,' said Harry coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea - '    'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'You're late, Potter,' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'On the count of three then,' said Snape lazily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'It's all right, Draco,' said Snape, lowering his wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'It's Professor Umbridge, sir - she needs your help,' said Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"Potter,' said Snape, 'we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Think I did,' said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"    'Me too,' said James."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"    'Nicked it,' said James casually."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Put that away, will you,' said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer, 'before Wormtail wets himself with excitement.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I'm bored,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'You might,' said Lupin darkly from behind his book."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"    'This'll liven you up, Padfoot,' said James quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,' said Sirius viciously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"  'Wash out your mouth,' said James coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said James, appearing to deliberate the point, 'it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    Many of the surrounding students laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn't, and nor did Lily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"    'I will if you go out with me, Evans,' said James quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lily,Gryffindor,"  'I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,' said Lily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Bad luck, Prongs,' said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"    'Certainly,' said James and he jerked his wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"  'Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,' said James earnestly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Reading between the lines, I'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_James,Gryffindor,"  'Right,' said James, who looked furious now, 'right - '    There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'So,' said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'N-no,' said Harry, trying to free his arm."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Pretty much,' said Harry, not looking at her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"'Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask - '    'No,' said Harry forcefully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I dunno,' said Ron, 'there's been a lot going on.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'That's for Quidditch practice,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I saw Cho earlier,' said Hermione tentatively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Wha- oh, yeah, we have,' said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been?
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, hi,' said Harry, pulling his books towards him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'It's over,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'It's Easter eggs from Mum,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It's not Cho I want to talk to,' said Harry brusquely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Come on,' said Harry dully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '    'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '    'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Easy,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,    'Er - ' said Harry.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '    'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '    'I should have made my meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '    'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Mcgonagall,Gryffindor,"  'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, 'he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Harry, 'it's nothing like that ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,He was only fifteen - '    'I'm fifteen' said Harry heatedly.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I'm not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, 'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - '    'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"said Sirius bracingly, 'we were all idiots!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well,' said Sirius, 'you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'And,' said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, 'he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,' said Sirius, shrugging, 'he couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'Nah, she didn't,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'She started going out with him in seventh year,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'Once James had deflated his head a bit,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,' said Lupin."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' said Lupin slowly, 'Snape was a special case."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,' said Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, OK,' said Harry heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Now you mention it,' said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, 'how did Snape react when he found you'd seen all this?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He told me he'd never teach me Occlumency again,' said Harry indifferently, 'like that's a big disappoint-    'He WHAT?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'OK, OK,' said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"    'No,' said Sirius, glancing behind him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"    'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Definitely,' said George."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_George,Gryffindor,"    'Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Course not, he'll recover,' said Ron indifferently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Reparo,' said Hermione quickly, mending Ron's cup with a wave of her wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'When Mum's next letter finally gets through Umbridge's screening process,' said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, 'I'm going to be in deep trouble."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'But - '    'It'll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,' said Ron darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, yes, that occurred to me, too,' said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, 'I've been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He hasn't,' said Harry curtly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, I did,' said Harry mutinously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, I suppose you'd better,' said Harry dully, ""specially if she thinks they're receiving stolen cauldrons or something.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Of course I am,' said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You know,' said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, 'if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, I s'pose so,' said Harry, glad of a change of subject."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I mean, we've won one, lost one - if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday - '    'Yeah, that's right,' said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'You know,' said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, 'I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"'No,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Course,' said Harry at once, 'course we'll come.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'I 'ppreciate this, you two, I really do,' said Hagrid as they reached the stairs."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, well, a bit o' trouble wouldn' hurt,' said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yeh - yeh'll see in a mo',' said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It'll be Ravenclaw,' said Harry heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Jus' a precaution,' said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You didn't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals,' said Hermione timidly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Nah, well, we weren' goin' in so far then,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"asked Hermione curiously    ""Cause the other centaurs are good an' riled at me, tha's why,' said Hagrid quietly, glancing around."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Hagrid heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yep,' said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Ah, no,' said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, 'no, it's not them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Bit further,' said Hagrid over his shoulder."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"fill yeh in,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Righ',' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Of course we'll help you,' said Harry at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'I knew yeh'd say yes,' said Hagrid into his handkerchief, 'but I won' ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Sleepin',' breathed Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid, you told us - ' said Hermione, her wand now shaking in her hand, 'you told us none of them, wanted to come!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"It was the curved back of what was clearly - '    'Well - no - he didn' want ter come,' said Hagrid, sounding desperate."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'I knew if I jus' got him back,' said Hagrid, sounding close to tears himself, 'an"" - an' taught him a few manners - I'd be able ter take him outside an' show ev'ryone he's harmless!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Hermione, I couldn' leave him,' said Hagrid, tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid, when you say ""brother"",' said Harry slowly, 'do you mean - ?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"well, tha's what it sounds like when he says his name,' said Hagrid anxiously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'She - well, she could see it was right importan' ter me,' said Hagrid, twisting his enormous hands."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well, tha's why it took so long, see,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Well, now - ""violent"" - tha's a bit harsh,' said Hagrid, still twisting his hands agitatedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Look after him,' said Hagrid croakily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah - even if yeh jus' talk ter him a bit,' said Hagrid hopefully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Anyway, Grawpy,' shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, 'I've brought some friends ter meet yeh."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, Hagrid, don't,' moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp's knee a sharp poke."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  This,' said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Herrmone stood, 'is Harry, Grawp!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'No, not at all,' squeaked Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Righ',' said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow, 'well ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I reckon tha's enough fer one day,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Hold it,' said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, blimey,' said Hagrid quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'I dunno how yeh work that out,' said Hagrid impatiently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'If yeh say so,' said Hagrid, shrugging, 'but personally I think yeh're makin' a big mistake - '    'As are you, human,' said Bane, 'coming back into our Forest when we warned you - '    'Now, yeh listen ter me,' said Hagrid angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'If yeh say so,' said Hagrid, shrugging, 'but personally I think yeh're makin' a big mistake - '    'As are you, human,' said Bane, 'coming back into our Forest when we warned you - '    'Now, yeh listen ter me,' said Hagrid angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid,' said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground, 'let's go, please let's go!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Hagrid,' said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, 'if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest, it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able - '    Ah, you heard what they said, said Hagrid dismissively, they wouldn't hurt foals - I mean, kids."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Hagrid,' said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, 'if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest, it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able - '    Ah, you heard what they said, said Hagrid dismissively, they wouldn't hurt foals - I mean, kids."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I don't know,' said Hermione miserably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Good idea,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I don't believe him,' said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Calm down,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You didn't mean that,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'And I wish they'd stop singing that stupid song,' said Hermione miserably, 'haven't they gloated enough?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,' said Hermione.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry 'Yes, all right,' said Hermione wearily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"said Harry 'Yes, all right,' said Hermione wearily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'm not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Er - ' said Harry    'Well, actually ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    Well - no,' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It was Hagrid,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yep,' said Harry grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I know, it's just that - we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Well,' he sighed, 'Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I dunno,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"  'I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Not any more,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt - '    This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"  'Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, 'so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'None at all,' said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tiny,#N/A,"    'I doubt it,' shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, 'not it Dumbledore doesn't want to be found!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, 'let me show you to the staff room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"I wasn't sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much - and on question twenty-three - '    'Hermione,' said Ron sternly, 'we've been through this before ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Parkinson,#N/A,"  Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, 'Parkinson, Pansy - Patil, Padma - Patil, Parvati - Potter."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Good luck,' said Ron quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Professor Tofty is free, Potter,' squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I mis-translated ehwaz,' said Hermione furiously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Ah well,' said Ron lazily, 'that's only one mistake, isn't it, you'll still get - '    'Oh, shut up!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"I don't know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off - by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg - '    'Good,' said Harry and Ron together."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He's teaching at the moment; she can't blame him,' said Harry, gesturing out of the window."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off towards the girls' dormitories, banging the door behind her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,' said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Parvati,Gryffindor,"  'Only four exams left,' said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Well, we were always going to fail that one,' said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'We shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Ahem - twenty minutes to go,' said Professor Tofty."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,said Professor McGonagall's voice through the darkness.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,HAVE SOME O' THAT - AN' THAT - '    'Oh my - ' gasped Hermione.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid's fists; indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"    'She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's,' said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'It'll be his giant blood,' said Hermione shakily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"    'Dreadful, dreadful,' said Ernie, shaking his head pompously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'I suppose so,' said Hermione, who looked tearful."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Urnbridge hates part-humans,' said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lee,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, blimey,' said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dean,Gryffindor,"    'She'd have sacked him anyway,' said Dean."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    That's true,' said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Colin,Gryffindor,"  They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,' said Colin Creevey."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Alicia,Gryffindor,"    'Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,' said Alicia Spinnet firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  Turn over your papers,' said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hour-glass."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"  'You'll have to kill me,' whispered Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry wildly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'll do that,' said Harry, nodding vigorously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I need to see Professor McGonagall,' gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Potter,Gryffindor,"  'I don't wonder you're shocked, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in her face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry blankly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I dunno how,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Harry,' said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, 'er ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Harry, think about this,' said Hermione, taking a step towards him, 'its five o'clock in the afternoon ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I've been - '    'You've never been there, Harry,' said Hermione quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'He's got a point,' said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Sirius might've cracked and just wanted some fresh air,' said Ron, sounding worried."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn't care about seeing hurt - '    'You know what, I've just thought of something,' said Ron in a hushed voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!'
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Look, I'm sorry,' cried Hermione, 'but neither of you is making sense, and we've got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there - '    'Hermione, Harry's seen them!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I mean, it was really great of you and everything,' said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face, 'everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do -    That's funny,' said Harry through gritted teeth, 'because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I mean, it was really great of you and everything,' said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face, 'everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do -    That's funny,' said Harry through gritted teeth, 'because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'But Harry, you've just said it,' said Hermione fiercely, 'Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you'd done Occlumency properly you'd never have seen this - '    'IF YOU THINK I'M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN - '    'Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Hi,' said Ginny uncertainly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Never you mind,' said Harry roughly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well, you can't,' said Harry shortly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'You're being rather rude, you know,' said Luna serenely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Wait,' said Hermione suddenly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We'll have to use Umbridge's fire and see if we can contact him, said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Right,' said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I'll do it,' said Ron at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,"" said Ginny promptly, 'and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garrotting Gas.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie; Ginny shrugged and said, 'Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'OK,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,' said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, 'not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Five minutes'll be enough,' said Harry 'C'mon, let's go - '    'Now?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Get over here,' muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    That's because it's colourless,' said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, 'but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we'll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn't believe us.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge's door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'A loud chorus of ""Weasley is our King"" if they see Umbridge coming,' replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'I want to know why you are in my office,' said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No one - ' said Harry, trying to pull away from her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Warrington,#N/A,"  'Got 'em all,' said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Good, good,' said Umbridge, watching Ginny's struggles."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'Ah, Professor Snape,' said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'Certainly,' said Snape, his lip curling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"    'I have already told you,' said Snape smoothly, 'that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Snape,Slytherin,"  'I have no idea,' said Snape coldly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"I do not want to,' said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, 'but sometimes circumstances justify the use ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,' said Umbridge quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him,' said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry's body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Somebody had to act,' breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry's forehead."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I'm - I'm sorry everyone,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Hermione's shoulders again and shook her slightly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"the weapon,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Y - y - yes,' gasped Hermione, 'but he had to leave before it was finished and n - n - now we've finished it for him, and we c - c - can't find him t - t - to tell him!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"said Umbridge harshly, her stubby hands still tight on Hermione's shoulders."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'We don't r - r - really understand it,' said Hermione, sniffing loudly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"them,' said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'It is not for you to set conditions,' said Professor Umbridge harshly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Fine,' said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'Professor,' said Malfoy eagerly, 'Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after - '    'I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'All right,' said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,' said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Yes,' said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'In there, of course,' said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"    'Of course,' said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"  'No, I don't think so, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh yes,' said Hermione, 'yes, it's well hidden.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Umbridge,Hufflepuff,"said Umbridge, in an even higher voice, 'so be very careful!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"shouted Hermione, but it was too late: Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, 'Incarcerous!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Please,' said Hermione breathlessly, 'please, don't attack us, We don't think like her, we aren't Ministry of Magic employees!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Goodness,' said Hermione, gripping Harry's arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, 'he - he remembered!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Oh no,' said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I'm not that fussed, to be honest,' said Harry bitterly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'We need to get back up to the castle,' said Hermione faintly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Well, we can't do anything without wands,' said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'So,' said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry's wand, 'had any ideas?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,' said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione's wand, too."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'She got carried away,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No, they got chased off by Grawp,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Hagrid's little brother,' said Ron promptly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, 'and I'm sure Sirius is still alive, but I can't see how we're going to get there to help him.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'OK,' said Harry irritably, rounding on her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, but you're not coming,' said Ron angrily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'You're too - ' Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, 'I'm three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosophers Stone, and it's because of me that Malfoy's stuck back in Umbridge's office with giant flying bogies attacking him - '    'Yeah, but - '    'We were all in the DA together,' said Neville quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,    'No - of course it wasn't - ' said Harry impatiently.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Then we should come too,' said Neville simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'That's right,' said Luna, smiling happily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, it doesn't matter, anyway,' said Harry through gritted teeth, 'because we still don't know how to get there - '    'I thought we'd settled that,' said Luna maddeningly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Well, it doesn't matter, anyway,' said Harry through gritted teeth, 'because we still don't know how to get there - '    'I thought we'd settled that,' said Luna maddeningly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Look,' said Ron, barely containing his anger, 'you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can't sprout wings whenever we - '    There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,' said Luna serenely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Look,' said Ron, barely containing his anger, 'you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can't sprout wings whenever we - '    There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,' said Luna serenely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can't fly,' said Luna in a dignified voice, 'but they can, and Hagrid says they're very good at finding places their riders are looking for.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'OK, fine, it's your choice,' he said curtly, 'but unless we can find more Thestrals you're not going to be able - '    'Oh, more of them will come,' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  There's no need,' said Luna, smiling."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"if I could just see it - '    'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Come on, said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed Harry's wand had sat, and which was now deserted."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'OK, listen,' said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the door."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'We're coming with you, Harry,' said Neville."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Let's get on with it,' said Ron firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through,' said Ginny in a hushed voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, that doesn't matter now,' said Harry forcefully, blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever, 'we won't need to get out till we've found Sirius - '    'Don't go calling for him, though!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Dunno,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"'Dad said the Ministry were breeding - '    'No,' said Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Let's get out of here,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    There are doors here, too,' said Ron, pointing around the walls."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Good thinking,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Let's go,' called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'I'm here, mate,' said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'I can hear them too,' breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted, 'there isn't any ""in there"", it's just an archway, there's no room for anybody to be there."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, but it didn't budge."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Right, we're leaving that room,' said Hermione decisively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It can't be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,' said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Something blibbering, no doubt,' said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'You said it was row ninety-seven,' whispered Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'We need to go right, I think,' whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He's right down at the end,' said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'He should be near here,' whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'It's - it's got your name on,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"    'Harry, I don't think you should touch it,' said Hermione sharply, as he stretched out his hand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'Don't, Harry,' said Neville suddenly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'It's got my name on,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'To me,' said Malfoy yet again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'Always,' echoed Malfoy softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You've got him,' said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,' said Malfoy softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I know Sirius is here,' said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,' said Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Go on, then,' said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,' said Malfoy coolly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'So,' said Harry, 'what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Nope, not jesting,' said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah,' said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'Do not play games with us, Potter,' said Malfoy."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'm not playing games,' said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, 'Smash shelves - '    'Dumbledore never told you?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Well, we don't stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It's Time,' said Hermione in an awestruck voice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,cried Hermione and the man's voice was extinguished.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  ""Whaddever you do, Harry,' said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, 'don'd gib it to him!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I've got to find the others,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Well, I'b going do find dem wid you,' said Neville firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'But Hermione - '    'We'll dake her wid us,' said Neville firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Wait,' said Harry, snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville's hand, 'you'd better take this.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'My gran's going do kill be,' said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, 'dat was by dad's old wand.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Harry,' said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, 'there you are ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'I think her ankle's broken, I heard something crack,' whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry's robes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'I don't know what they hit him with,' said Luna sadly, 'but he's gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Harry,' said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, 'you know who this girl is, Harry?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'We've got to get out of here,' said Harry firmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Yes,' said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around Ginny's waist and pulling her up."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then t soared towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unravelling like rolls of film -    'Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it - ' said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, 'Harry, come and touch it; bet it's weird - '    'RON, NO!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"screamed Ginny, immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor - then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters, 'STUBEFY, STUBEFY!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lucius,Slytherin,"  'You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor's encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, 'Someone Stun him!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Neville, trying to pull himself up."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew towards them."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville's robes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry's shoulder."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'He can't come back, Harry,' said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Here,' said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville's legs he said, 'Finite.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"  'Dey're all back dere,' said Neville."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin's slackened grip."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"Slipping and sliding, he ran on towards the door; he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, who said, 'Harry - what - ?', past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry's seemed to chorus I am!"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"said Harry, with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix's own."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Voldemort,Slytherin,"'Master, you should know - '    'Be quiet, Bella,' said Voldemort dangerously."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"And then he breathed, 'Dumbledore!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,' said Dumbledore calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'You are quite wrong,' said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore - apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor) - 'you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I shall see you in half an hour,' said Dumbledore quietly 'One ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  Thank you,' said Dumbledore softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Well, Harry,' said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, 'you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night's events.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up,' said Dumbledore 'Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St Mungos, but it seems she will make a full recovery.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I know how you're feeling, Harry,' said Dumbledore very quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'No, you don't,' said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own - '    That's enough, Phineas,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'You do care,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yes, you do,' said Dumbledore, still more calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'No,' said Dumbledore simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'If you don't - if you keep me in here - if you don't let me - '    'By all means continue destroying my possessions,' said Dumbledore serenely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Not until I have had my say,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'You will,' said Dumbledore steadily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'It is my fault that Sirius died,' said Dumbledore clearly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Please sit down,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"  'Am I to understand,' said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left, 'that my great-great-grandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Yes, Phineas,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Phineas,Slytherin,"  'I don't believe it,' said Phineas brusquely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Harry, I owe you an explanation,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I guessed, fifteen years ago,' said Dumbledore, 'when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'You've told me this before, Professor,' said Harry bluntly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Dumbledore apologetically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I know,' said Harry wearily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'More recently,' said Dumbledore, 'I became concerned that Voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'But I didn't,' muttered Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,"'I didn't practise, I didn't bother, I could've stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he'd never have been able to show me where to go, and - Sirius wouldn't - 'Sirius wouldn't - '    Something was erupting inside Harry's head: a need to justify himself, to explain - '    'I tried to check he'd really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge's office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn't there, he said he'd gone!'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Kreacher lied,' said Dumbledore calmly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,' said Dumbledore, 'when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ""get out""."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Kreacher told me last night,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, yes,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,' said Dumbledore quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'He did not wish to tell me,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'And,' whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, 'and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him - '    'She was quite right, Harry,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'And,' whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, 'and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him - '    'She was quite right, Harry,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Sirius,Gryffindor,'I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect.
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'Kreacher's a lying - foul - he deserved - '    'Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual - '    'Harry you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,' said Dumbledore steadily, 'but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - 'he made out Sirius was a coward - '    'Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'I am aware of it,' said Dumbledore heavily."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence - '    'Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him - ' Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on '- how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my - '    'I trust Severus Snape,' said Dumbledore simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Sirius did not hate Kreacher,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that's why he wanted to get out last night - '    'I was trying to keep Sirius alive,' said Dumbledore quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'She doesn't love me,' said Harry at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Wait,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"You told her to remember - it was your voice - '    'I thought,' said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, 'that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'It did,' said Harry quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I don't understand what you're saying,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'I don't - '    'I cared about you too much,' said Dumbledore simply."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I did,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'It meant,' said Dumbledore, 'that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    The official record was re-labelled after Voldemort's attack on you as a child,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I am afraid,' said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, 'that there is no doubt that it is you.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'But you said - Neville was born at the end of July, too - and his mum and dad - '    'You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then - '    That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,' said Dumbledore, 'except that Voldemort's information about the prophecy was incomplete."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"'I haven't any powers he hasn't got, I couldn't fight the way he did tonight, I can't possess people or - or kill them - '    There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,' interrupted Dumbledore, 'that is kept locked at all times."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"while the other survives,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'So,' said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, 'so does that mean that ."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Dumbledore."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Dumbledore,Gryffindor,"  'I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,' said Dumbledore hesitantly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Meanwhile, the ""Boy Who Lived"" - 'There you are, Harry, I knew they'd drag you into it somehow,' said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes, they're very complimentary about you now, Harry,' said Hermione, scanning down the article."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"Well,' said Hermione, folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside, 'it's certainly given them lots to write about."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Daddy sold it to them,' said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The Quibbler."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'So, anyway,' said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, 'what's going on in school?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Well, Flitwick's got rid of Fred and George's swamp,' said Ginny, 'he did it in about three seconds."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,' said Ginny, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,' said Ron, through a mouthful of chocolate."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"They sent me all these, you know,' he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Neville,Gryffindor,"    'Yes,' said Neville, 'everything's settled right back to normal.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Not at all,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"  'Sulking, more like,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Speaking of centaurs,' said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, 'who's Divination teacher now?"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'He's got to,' said Harry, 'the other centaurs won't take him back, will they?'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,' said Ginny."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Bet Dumbledore wishes he could've got rid of Trelawney for good,' said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Yeah, it is,' said Ron."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Er - Hagrid's,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"    'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  'You're going to pay,' said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well, I'm terrified now,' said Harry sarcastically."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"    'You think you're such a big man, Potter,' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"You can't land my father in prison - '    'I thought I just had,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Malfoy,Slytherin,"  The Dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,' said Harry fiercely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'Yes, Professor Snape,' said Professor McGonagall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Here,' said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe's chest and her cloak into Goyle's, 'take these up to my office for me.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"  'Right then,' said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Professor,#N/A,"    'So that's fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,' said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor s hour-glass as she spoke."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"    'Bin hidin' out in the mountains,' said Hagrid."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'You - you look better,' said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Ev'ryone knows yeh've bin tellin' the truth now, Harry' said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hagrid,Gryffindor,"  'Oh,' said Hagrid, looking rather upset."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'No - Nick - please,' said Harry, 'I really need to talk to you."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"  'You to come and find me,' said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Harry, refusing to be deflected."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'It's - ' said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, 'it's just - you're dead."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'Oh,' said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"    'Sirius Black,' said Nick."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"'You came back - you're dead and you didn't disappear - '    'Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,' said Nick miserably."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"    'I cannot answer,' said Nick."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"    'I was afraid of death,' said Nick softly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Nick,Gryffindor,"  'I am sorry not to have been more help,' said Nick gently."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Hello,' said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Well, I've lost most of my possessions,' said Luna serenely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'No,' said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"    'Yes,' said Luna simply, 'my mother."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Yes, it was rather horrible,' said Luna conversationally."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Luna,Ravenclaw,"  'Oh, no,' said Luna."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ernie,Gryffindor,"  'I must say, I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mothers face when he gets off the train,' said Ernie, with some satisfaction, as    he watched Malfoy squirm above him."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Goyle's mum'll be really pleased, though,' said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'It hasn't really started yet,' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"'But it won't be long now    'Hey, Harry,' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Nothing,' said Harry truthfully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'Michael - but - ' said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ginny,Gryffindor,"    'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Fred,Gryffindor,"  'Finest dragonskin, little bro',' said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Hello, Harry,' said Lupin, as Mrs Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"  'Hi,' said Harry."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"    'Well,' said Lupin with a slight smile, 'we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.'"
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Harry,Gryffindor,"    'I dunno if that's a good idea,' said Harry at once."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Tonks,Hufflepuff,"  'Anyway, that's not the point,' interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"'The point is, if we find out you've been horrible to Harry - '    - And make no mistake, we'll hear about it,' added Lupin pleasantly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Yes,' said Mr Weasley, 'even if you won't let Harry use the felly-tone -    'Telephone,' whispered Hermione."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Lupin,Gryffindor,"  'Take care, Harry,' said Lupin quietly."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Ron,Gryffindor,"  'We'll see you soon, mate,' said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry's hand."
Book_Order_Of_The_Phoenix,Book_Hermione,Gryffindor,"  'Really soon, Harry,' said Hermione earnestly."
