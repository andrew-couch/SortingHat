Draco Malfoy,"You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.",
Dumbledore,"It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live.",
Dumbledore,"What happened down in the dungeon between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows.",
Dumbledore,"Only a person who wanted to find the Stone - find it, but not use it – would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something.",
Dumbledore,"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.",
Severus Snape,"There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention. Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?...And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?...Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?",
Severus Snape,"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell... We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.",
Dumbledore, [to the cat] I should have known that you would be here... Professor McGonagall.,
McGonagall," Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?",
Dumbledore," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good and the bad.",
McGonagall, And the boy?,
Dumbledore, Hagrid is bringing him.,
McGonagall, Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?,
Dumbledore," Ah, Professor. I would trust Hagrid with my life.",
Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.",
Dumbledore," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?",
Hagrid," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. [hands Dumbledore a bundle – Harry] Try not to wake him. There you go.",
McGonagall," Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day, they're the worst sort of... Muggles imaginable. They really are–",
Dumbledore, The only family he has.,
McGonagall, This boy will be famous! There won't be a child in our world that doesn't know his name!,
Dumbledore," Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that... until he is ready. [Dumbledore places Harry on the doorstep. Hagrid snivels.] There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. [Hagrid nods. Dumbledore places a letter on Harry.] Good luck... Harry Potter.",
Dudley, [about his gifts] How many are there?,
Uncle Vernon," 36, counted them myself.",
Dudley," 36?! But last year, last year I had 37!",
Uncle Vernon," I mean– Yes, yes. Well, some are a quite a bit bigger than last year's –",
Dudley, I don't care how big they are!,
Uncle Vernon," Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?",
Harry, [when Dudley doesn't answer] Because there’s no post on Sundays?,
Uncle Vernon," Right you are, Harry! [takes cookie from Harry] Right you are. No post on Sundays. Hah!",
Harry, Excuse me. Who are you?,
Hagrid," Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.",
Harry," Sorry, no.",
Hagrid," No? Blimey, Harry, did you ever wonder where your Mum and Dad learned it all?",
Harry, Learnt what?,
Hagrid," You're a wizard, Harry.",
Harry, I– I'm a what?,
Hagrid," A wizard! And a thumpin' good 'un, I'll wager, once you've been trained up a bit.",
Harry," I think you've made a mistake. I mean, I... can't be a... a wizard. I mean, I'm... just... Harry. Just Harry.",
Hagrid," Well, ""Just Harry""... did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?",
Harry," [to the Dursleys; angrily after Vernon refuses Harry's entrance to Hogwarts because they swore when they took him in to ""put a stop to all this rubbish""] You knew? You knew all along, and you never told me?!",
Aunt Petunia," [bitterly] Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being what she was. My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. ""We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?"" I was the only one who saw her for what she was"," a freak! And then she met that Potter, and she had you, and I knew you'd be the same. Just as strange, just as... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up, and we got landed with you."
Harry," ""Blown up""? You told me my parents died in a car crash!",
Hagrid, [shocked and angry] A car crash?! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter?!,
Aunt Petunia, [sheepishly] We had to say something...,
Hagrid, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!,
Uncle Vernon, He will not be going!,
Hagrid," [somewhat amused] Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's gonna stop him, are ya?",
Harry," ""Muggle""?",
Hagrid," Non-magic folk. [to the Dursleys, angrily] This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen"," Albus Dumbledore. [In the meantime, Hagrid is unaware of Dudley stealing the cake he made for Harry]"
Uncle Vernon, I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks!,
Hagrid, Never... insult Albus Dumbledore... in front of me.,
Ollivander, Curious... Very curious...,
Harry, Sorry... but what's curious?,
Ollivander," I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. And it just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand, when its brother gave you that scar.",
Harry, ....And who owned that wand?,
Ollivander," We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But. I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes... but great.",
Harry," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. [points to his scar. Hagrid looks hesitant to respond] You know, Hagrid, I know you do.",
Hagrid," [sighs and leans towards him] First – and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important – not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. And a few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V– [becomes tense] His name was V–",
Harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?,
Hagrid," Nah, I can't spell it. All right... [in a whisper] Voldemort.",
Harry, Voldemort?,
Hagrid," [frantically] Shh! It was dark times, Harry, dark times. [As Hagrid narrates, we see a flashback of a robed, hooded figure - Voldemort - breaking into Harry's parents' home and striking his mother dead; it ends just as Voldemort aims his wand at baby Harry] Voldemort started to gather some followers; brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. Nobody. Not one. Except you.",
Harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill... me?,
Hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on yer forehead. A mark like that only comes from bein' touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.",
Harry, And what happened to Vol– To You-Know-Who?,
Hagrid," Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's still out there somewhere, too tired to carry on. But one thing's fer certain", Somethin' about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everyone knows your name. You're the Boy Who Lived.
Hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.,
Ron, No.,
Hermione," [sees Ron attempting magic] Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.",
Ron," [clears throat] Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow... turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!",
Hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good is it? [Ron gives Harry an indignant and exasperated look] Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself, but they've all worked for me. For example, [sits in front of Harry] Oculus Reparo.",
Ron," [muffled] Um, Ron Weasley.",
Hermione," [chagrined] Pleasure. You two best change into robes, I expect we'll be arriving soon. [leaves, but turns around to face Ron] You've got dirt on your nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there.",
Draco Malfoy," So it's true, then. What they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. [All the first years murmur in excitement; Draco indicates two boys next to him] This is Crabbe, and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. [Ron sniggers; Draco turns to glare at him] Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down-robe? You must be a Weasley. [turns back to Harry] You'll soon find out some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [offers his hand]",
Harry," [coldly] I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.",
Ron, Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters.,
Fred," Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too badly! Can't make any promises. Rough game, Quidditch.",
George, Brutal! But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally (Harry and Ron walk off) but they'll turn up in a month or two!,
Ron, What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?,
Hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",
Ron, I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. They were three!,
Hermione," It was standing on a trapdoor. Which means, it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.",
Harry, Guarding something?,
Hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. [Goes into her dormitory]",
Ron, She needs to sort out her priorities.,
Oliver," [Leading Harry to practice, carrying a trunk] Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players"," Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and a Seeker. That's you. [Opens trunk and takes a round ball with four indents in it out] There are three kinds of balls. [Tosses it to Harry] This one's called the Quaffle. The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. [Points to three hoops on opposite end of field.] The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far?"
Harry, I think so. [Tosses Quaffle back to Oliver] What are those? [Acknowledges two other balls],
Oliver," Oh. [Takes out a bat, a little shorter that a baseball bat] You better take this. [Hands bat to Harry, then unlatches one of the balls from trunk. It shoots up into the air, then zooms back down] Careful now, it's comin' back. [Harry whacks the ball with the bat. The ball zooms off in another direction right though the gap of a statue that has crossed swords] Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. [The ball comes back heading directly for Oliver] Uh-oh. [It whacks him in the chest, knocking him over. He fights with it to get it back in the trunk. He eventually succeeds, and locks it back in]",
Harry, What was that thing?,
Oliver, [Panting] Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you... [Points to Harry]...are a Seeker. [Takes out walnut-sized gold ball with silver wings] The only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. [Hands it to Harry],
Harry, I like this ball.,
Oliver," Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.",
Harry, What do I do with it?,
Oliver," You catch it... before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game's over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.",
Hagrid, Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?,
Harry, Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Hallowe'en?,
Hagrid, Who told you about Fluffy?,
Ron," ""Fluffy""?!",
Hermione, That thing has a name?,
Hagrid," Of course, he's got a name! He's mine! I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. The I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the–",
Harry, Yes?,
Hagrid," Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top-secret, that is.",
Harry," But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.",
Hagrid, Codswallop! Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher!,
Hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.",
Harry, Exactly.,
Hagrid," Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.",
Ron," [In a timid, high voice] Okay.",
Hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.",
Malfoy," Okay, then I get Fang.",
Hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.",
Snape," Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?",
Hermione," We... [Snape looks to her, expecting an answer]...we were just...",
Snape, You ought to be more careful. People may think you're...[Snape notices Harry eyeing him cautiously. He glares sharply at Harry]...up to something.,
Harry," You? No, it can't– it can't be. Snape, he was– he was the one who–",
Quirrell," Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? But next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?",
Harry," But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.",
Quirrell," No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded! Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.",
Harry, Snape was... trying to save me?,
Quirrell," I knew you were a danger to me right from the off, especially after Halloween.",
Harry, Th-th-then you let the troll in!,
Quirrell," Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He barely left me alone. But he doesn't understand - I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? Yes, I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?!",
Voldemort, Use the boy.,
Quirrell," COME HERE, POTTER!!! NOW!!! [Harry walks to Quirrell and the Mirror of Erised] Tell me. What do you see? [Harry sees his reflection take out the Philosopher's Stone, then places it into his pocket. He realizes that it actually is in his pocket.] What is it, what do you see?!",
Harry, I– I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.,
Voldemort, He lies.,
Quirrell, TELL THE TRUTH!!! WHAT DO YOU SEE?!,
Voldemort, Let me speak to him.,
Quirrell," Master, you are not strong enough!",
Voldemort, I have strength enough for this...,
Voldemort, Harry Potter. We meet again.,
Harry, Voldemort?,
Voldemort," Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [Harry attempts to escape] STOP HIM! [Quirrell blocks Harry by snapping his fingers, causing a large fire to block off the entrance] Don't be a fool. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me and live?",
Harry, Never!,
Voldemort," [laughs] Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... would you like to see your mother and father again? [Harry's parents appear in the Mirror of Erised] Together, we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. [Harry pulls the Stone out of his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power... and those too weak to seek it. Together, we can do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone!",
Harry, [screams] YOU LIAR!,
Voldemort," KILL HIM! [Quirrell flies into the air and begins choking Harry. Harry tries to reach for the stone, but grabs Quirrell's wrist, and suddenly makes it immediately begin to burn and turn into ash. Quirrell gasps, screams, and lets go of Harry in fear and he starts to panic] What is this magic?! Fool! Get the Stone!",
Dumbledore," Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry reaches up to touch his scar] No, no. This kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.",
Harry, What is it?,
Dumbledore," [smiling] Love, Harry. Love.",
Hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?",
Harry, I'm not going home... not really.,
Harry," Hi, Hedwig. [Hedwig has just flown down to the table where Harry, Ron and Hermoine are studying]",
Hermione, Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.,
Ron, I'm ready! Ask me any question.,
Hermione," All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?",
Ron, ...I forgot.,
Hermione," And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?",
Ron, Copy off you?,
Hermione," No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.",
Ron," That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us! [checks a card, irritated] Dumbledore again!",
Ron," [Neville comes hopping in, his legs apparently stuck together] Leg-Locker Curse?",
Harry, Malfoy. [Neville approaches them amidst laughter from the other students],
Ron," You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.",
Neville Longbottom, [wobbling uncontrollably] How? I can barely stand at all!,
Seamus Finnigan," [jumping up, wand at the ready] I'll do the counter-curse!",
Neville Longbottom," No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!",
Seamus Finnigan," [slamming his wand down angrily] I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back! [stalks off angrily, showing a large chunk of hair missing from the back of his head]",
Harry, I found him! [hands Ron a Chocolate Frog card of Dumbledore],
Ron," 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–'",
Harry, Go on.,
Ron," '-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'",
Harry, I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.,
Hermione, [beaming excitedly] Follow me!,
Neville Longbottom," Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?! [before he can say another word he topples over backwards, the other students start laughing]",
Harry, Will I have to wear that too?,
Petunia," You? Go to Smeltings? [Harry nods, questionably]",
Uncle Vernon, HA!,
Aunt Petunia," Don't be so stupid, you're going to go the state school where you belong. [Goes to the kitchen and fishes out a grey shirt in a boiler.] And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.",
Harry, But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.,
Draco Malfoy," Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.",
Ginny Weasley, Leave him alone.,
Draco Malfoy," [Smirking] Oh, look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend.",
Lucius Malfoy," [Places the silver snake of his walking stick on Draco's shoulder] Now, now, Draco. Play nicely. [To Harry] Mr. Potter. Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me. [uses the silver snake to pull back Harry's bangs; sees his scar] Your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.",
Harry, [firmly] Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.,
Lucius Malfoy," Hmm, you must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish.",
Hermione, [Indirectly quoting Dumbledore] Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.,
Lucius Malfoy," And you must be... Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you... and your parents. [glances at the Grangers, who are speaking with Mr. Weasley] Muggles, aren't they? [Looks at Ron] Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions... [Takes a book out of Ginny's cauldron] Tatty, secondhand book. [Smiles coldly] You must be the Weasleys.",
Arthur Weasley," [Arriving and attempting to ignore Mr. Malfoy ] Children, it's mad in here. Let's go outside.",
Lucius Malfoy," Well, well, well. Weasley Senior.",
Arthur Weasley, Lucius.,
Lucius Malfoy," Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur. All those extra raids; I do hope they're paying you overtime. [Picks up one of Ginny's books] Though judging by the state of this, I'd say not. [Places the book back in Ginny's cauldron; another book has been slipped in with it, though only Harry notices] What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard... if they don't even pay you well for it?",
Arthur Weasley," We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.",
Lucius Malfoy, Clearly. Associating with Muggles... And I thought your family could sink no lower. [Mr. Weasley glares at Mr Malfoy.] I'll see you at work.,
Draco Malfoy, See you at school.,
Snape's voice, You were seen! By no less than seven Muggles! [He throws the newspaper down and glares at Harry and Ron] Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world! Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.,
Ron," Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.",
Snape," Silence! I assure you that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home, tonight! As it is...",
Dumbledore, They are not.,
Harry, Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.,
Snape, Headmaster... these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...,
Dumbledore," I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.",
Ron," We'll go and get our stuff, then.",
McGonagall," What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?",
Ron," You're going to expel us, aren't you?",
McGonagall," Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detentions.",
Dean Thomas, Ron? Is that your owl?,
Ron, That bloody bird's a menace. [looks at the letter] Oh no!,
Seamus Finnigan," Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!",
Neville Longbottom," Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once... [looking uneasy] It was horrible!",
Mrs. Weasley via Howler," RONALD WEASLEY!!!!! (The Howler forms itself into a ranting mouth) HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR?!?!? I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!!!!! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!!!!! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!!!!! (The Howler turns to Ginny, who is eating her breakfast; its voice is now quiet and loving) Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. (The Howler turns back to Ron and blows a raspberry at him, then tears itself to pieces)",
Ron, Those are Nimbus Two-Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?,
Marcus Flint, A gift from Draco's father.,
Draco Malfoy," You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.",
Hermione, At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.,
Draco Malfoy," [Annoyed] No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.",
Ron," You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! Eat slugs!",
Hermione," You okay, Ron? [Ron's face turns green] Say something!",
Colin Creevey," [starts taking pictures of Ron] Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?",
Harry Potter," No, Colin! Get out of the way. [he and Hermione help Ron to his feet] Let's take him to Hagrid. [Ron regurgitates another slug] He'll know what to do.",
Minerva McGonagall," Yes, Miss Granger?",
Hermione Granger," Professor, I was wondering if you'd tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.",
Professor Minerva McGonagall," [seeing everyone's faces] Very well. Well, you all knew, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago, by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age",
Ron Weasley, [Sarcastic] Three guesses who.,
Professor Minerva McGonagall," Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families – in other words, ""pure-bloods"". Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though shortly before departing, he sealed it... until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.",
Hermione Granger, Muggle-borns.,
Professor Minerva McGonagall," Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found.",
Hermione Granger," Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?",
Minerva McGonagall, Well the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. it is said to be the home... of a monster.,
Gilderoy Lockhart," Let me introduce my assistant... Professor Snape. [Snape grudgingly walks up onto the platform] He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him! Never fear. [Lockhart and Snape approach each other, bow to each other, walk a fair distance apart and ready their wands.] One, two, three...",
Snape, Expelliarmus!,
Hermione, [concerned] Do you think he's all right?,
Ron, [laughs] Who cares?,
Gilderoy Lockhart," An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape! But if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious, uh, what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy–",
Snape," [losing patience] Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor?",
Gilderoy Lockhart," An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Uh... Let's have a volunteer pair. Uh, Potter, Weasley. How about you?",
Snape," Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. He'd be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?",
Draco Malfoy," Scared, Potter?",
Harry, You wish.,
Percy Weasley, Excuse me!,
Ron Weasley [as Vincent Crabbe]," What are you doing dow– [Harry hits him; Ron clears his throat and speaks more authoritatively] I mean, What are you doing down here?",
Percy Weasley," I happen to be a school Prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors this time of night. What's your names again?",
Ron Weasley [as Vincent Crabbe], Uh...,
Harry Potter [as Gregory Goyle], I'm...,
Draco Malfoy," [Rounding a corner] Crabbe! Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? [Looks oddly at Harry, who is still wearing his glasses] Why are you wearing glasses?",
Harry Potter [as Gregory Goyle], [Quickly removes his glasses] Um... Um... reading.,
Draco Malfoy," Reading? [Harry nods] I didn't know you could read. [Turns to Percy] And what are you doing down here, Weasley?",
Percy Weasley," Mind your attitude, Malfoy.",
Draco Malfoy," You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world – all of them! [Ron (disguised as Crabbe) clenches his fist angrily] What's wrong with you, Crabbe?",
Ron, [gets nudged by Harry (disguised as Goyle)] Ahem... stomachache.,
Draco Malfoy," You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.",
Harry, You're wrong!,
Draco Malfoy," [sternly] What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? [""Goyle"" doesn't reply.] Well? Do you?",
Harry, [gulps] Harry Potter?,
Draco Malfoy," Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?",
Harry," Well, then, you must have some idea who's behind it all.",
Draco Malfoy," You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? [picks up the package and shakes it] Is this yours? [Harry shakes his head] But, my father did say this",
Harry, It's his... stomachache.,
Myrtle, Come to throw something else at me?,
Harry, Why would I throw something at you?,
Myrtle," Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.",
Ron," But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you.",
Myrtle," [flies down at him furiously] SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get it through her stomach! [punches through Ron's] Fifty points if it goes through her HEAD! [punches through his]",
Harry," But who threw it at you, anyway?",
Myrtle," [more calmly] I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, [sighs] and it fell through the top of my head. Mm-hmm! [nods and floats away, sobbing]",
Harry, It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber if Secrets 50 years ago.,
Hermoine, It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.,
Ron, We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty rotten snitch to me.,
Harry," The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?",
Hermione," Look, Hagrid is our friend, so why don't we just go and ask him?",
Ron," [Sarcastically] That will be a cheerful visit. ""Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you sent anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?""",
Hagrid," [Appears from behind] Mad and hairy? Yer wouldn't be talkin' about me, now are ya?",
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione", No!,
'Harry," [notices the canister of liquid Hagrid is carrying] What's that you've got, Hagrid?",
Hagrid," Oh, it's, uh, flesh-eating slug repellent. For the mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they’ve still got a bit of growing to do. But, once their acne’s been cleared up, we’ll be able to chop them and stew them, and then we’ll get those people down at the hospital un-petrified. In the meantime, though, you three... had best be looking after yourselves, all right? [turns and walks back where he came from; Neville starts running from in the direction Hagrid’s going] Hello, Neville.",
Neville," Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!",
Hagrid," [knowing that Harry and Ron are inside the hut, in the invisibility cloak] If... um... If anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yep. That would leave them right. That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.",
Cornelius Fudge," [to Fang] Good boy. [He, Hagrid and Lucius Malfoy leave. Harry and Ron remove the cloak of invisibility.]",
Ron," Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.",
Harry," Look. [sees a trail of spiders on Hagrid's window] Come on. [grabs a lantern] Come on, Fang. Come on.",
Ron, What?,
Harry," You heard what Hagrid said. ""Follow the spiders.""",
Ron," They're heading to the Dark Forest! [Harry ignores him] Why spiders?! Why couldn't be ""follow the butterflies""?! [follows Harry out the door]",
Aragog, Who is it?,
Harry, [to a terrified Ron] Don't panic.,
Aragog, Hagrid? Is that you?,
Harry," We're friends of Hagrid. [A colossal, tarantula-like spider emerges] You... You're Aragog, aren't you?",
Aragog, Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.,
Harry," Well, he's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before.",
Aragog, That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.,
Harry, Then you're not the monster?,
Aragog," No. The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.",
Ron, [noticing other giant spiders around them; whimpering] Harry...,
Harry," Shush. [to Aragog] Well, if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?",
Aragog, We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature that we spiders fear above all others.,
Harry, But have you seen it?,
Aragog," I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.",
Ron, [sounding like he's about to cry] Harry?,
Harry, [irritated] What?! [Ron points upwards in terror – giant spiders descend and surround them] [to Aragog] Well... thank you. We'll just go.,
Aragog," Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command, but I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friends of Hagrid.",
Ron, [to Harry] Can we panic now? [the spiders move in for the attack] Know any spells?,
Harry, One – but it's not powerful enough for all of them.,
Ron, Where's Hermione when you need her?,
Harry," [reads the paper from the book taken by Hermione] ""Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it."" Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.",
Ron," But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?",
Harry," Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin– Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.",
Ron," And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.",
Harry," The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. [reads again] ""Spiders flee before it."" It all fits!",
Ron," But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it.",
Harry, Hermione's answered that too.,
Ron," ""Pipes?"" It's using the plumbing!",
Harry, Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?,
Ron, Moaning Myrtle.,
Minerva McGonagall," As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself! The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.",
Lockhart, [entering] So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?,
Snape," A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.",
Lockhart, My moment?,
Snape, Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?,
Minerva McGonagall," That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.",
Lockhart, Very well. I'll just be in my office getting... getting ready.,
Poppy Pomfrey," Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?",
Minerva McGonagall, Ginny Weasley.,
Ron," [reads it] ""Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever"". Ginny...",
Harry, Are you going somewhere?,
Lockhart," [nervously] Um, well, yes. Urgent call, unavoidable. Got to go...",
Ron, What about my sister?!,
Lockhart," Well, as to that - most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I...",
Ron, You're the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!,
Lockhart," I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description--",
Harry," You're running away, after all that stuff you did in your books?!",
Lockhart, Books can be misleading.,
Harry, You wrote them!,
Lockhart," My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!",
Harry," [realizing, outraged] You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!",
Ron, Is there anything you can do?,
Lockhart," Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. And now, I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you--",
Harry, Don't even think about it.,
Harry, It's a snake skin.,
Ron," Bloody hell. Whoever shed this must be 60 feet long, or more. [Lockhart pretends to pass out. Ron notices.] Heart of a lion, this one.",
Lockhart," [jumps up and grabs Ron's wand; aims the wand at Harry, then at Ron, then at Harry again] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. [Points it at Ron] The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [Aims it at Harry] You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye... to your memories. Obliviate!",
Ron, Harry?! Harry!,
Harry," Ron! Ron, are you okay?",
Ron, I'm fine.,
Gilderoy Lockhart, [sits up and grins at Ron] Hello. Who are you?,
Ron," Uh, Ron Weasley.",
Gilderoy Lockhart," Really? And, um, who-who am I?",
Ron, [to Harry] Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!,
Gilderoy Lockhart," [picks up a rock] It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? Do you live here?",
Ron, [takes the rock from Lockhart] No.,
Gilderoy Lockhart, Really?,
Ron, What do I do now?,
Harry, You wait here and try to shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.,
Ron, Okay.,
Harry, Ginny. [Runs to her] Ginny. Ginny. Please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up!,
Tom Riddle, [suddenly appears out of nowhere] She won't wake.,
Harry, Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won't wake? She's not...?,
Tom Riddle," She's still alive, but only just.",
Harry, Are you a ghost?,
Tom Riddle," A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.",
Harry," [touches her hand] She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [Tom picks up Harry's wand] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk--",
Tom Riddle, It won't come until it's called.,
Harry," Give me my wand, Tom.",
Tom Riddle, You won't be needing it.,
Harry," Listen, we've got to go, we've got to save her!",
Tom Riddle," I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger. Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.",
Harry," No. She couldn't. I mean, she wouldn't!",
Tom Riddle, It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and Filch's cat. [flashback of Ginny watching the Chamber's entrance in the toilets open] It was Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [flashback of Ginny writing the massages],
Harry, But why?,
Tom Riddle," Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very... persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was in, shall we say, a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her, and she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. [flashback of Ginny running into a toilet cubicle and throwing the diary into the toilet] And then who should find it... but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.",
Harry, And why did you want to meet me?,
Tom Riddle," I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.",
Harry," [angrily] Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?",
Tom Riddle, It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.,
Harry, [smiling] I bet Dumbledore saw right through you.,
Tom Riddle," He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary – preserving my sixteen year-old self in its pages so that one day, I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.",
Harry," Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.",
Tom Riddle," Haven't I told you? Killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target... has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape, with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?",
Harry, Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.,
Tom Riddle," Voldemort... is my past, present, and future. [uses Harry's wand to write his full name in midair",
Harry, [stunned] You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.,
Tom Riddle," Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name. A name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!",
Harry, Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!,
Tom Riddle, Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!,
Harry, He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Fawkes suddenly enters the chamber] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops the Sorting Hat to Harry and leaves],
Tom Riddle, So... this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender,
Lucius Malfoy," The culprit has been identified, I presume?",
Albus Dumbledore," Oh, yes.",
Lucius Malfoy, And...? Who was it?,
Albus Dumbledore, [after exchanging a look with Harry] Voldemort.,
Lucius Malfoy, Ah.,
Albus Dumbledore," Only this time, he chose to act through somebody else... by means of this. [He reveals Tom Riddle's diary – which Lucius had slipped into Ginny's cauldron. Dobby tugs Harry's sleeve uneasily and looks over at Lucius.]",
Lucius, I see.,
Dumbledore," Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... severe.",
Lucius Malfoy, Well... let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.,
Harry, Don't worry. I will be.,
Harry, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! [Lucius turns around] I have something of yours. [Hands him the diary],
Lucius Malfoy, Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.,
Harry," Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.",
Lucius Malfoy," You do, do you? [Hands the diary to Dobby] Well...[Whispers] why don't you prove it? [Harry doesn't answer because he just did] Come, Dobby.",
Harry, [Whispers to Dobby] Open it.,
Lucius Malfoy, Dobby?,
Dobby, Master has given Dobby a sock.,
Lucius Malfoy, What? [Turns around] I didn't give–,
Dobby, [Holding the sock in delight] Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free.,
Lucius Malfoy, [Furious] You lost me my SERVANT! [Pulls his wand from his cane and aims it directly at Harry. Dobby then stands in his way],
Dobby, You shall not harm Harry Potter!,
Lucius Malfoy," [About to curse Harry] Avada– [Dobby blasts him backwards across the hall; Lucius stands] Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. Mark my words, Potter",
Harry Potter,Diagonally!,
Harry Potter,You wish.,
Harry Potter,"""Tom Marvolo Riddle.""",
Harry Potter,My name is Harry Potter.,
Harry Potter,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?,
Harry Potter,Can you tell me?,

Harry Potter,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.,

Albus Dumbledore,"In light of recent events, as a school treat... all exams have been cancelled!",
Draco Malfoy,"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.",
Draco Malfoy,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.",
Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?",
Lucius Malfoy,"Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. Mark my words, Potter: one day soon, you're going to meet the same, sticky end.",
Arthur Weasley,"Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me. What exactly is the function of a rubber duck?",
Harry,I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home.,
Harry,"Mr. Weasley, Why would I go looking for somebody who wants to kill me?",
Harry,[to Sirius] I know why! You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!,
Harry,"[quietly] He was their friend... and he betrayed them... [yelling] HE WAS THEIR FRIEND! [echoes] I hope he finds me! 'Cause when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!",
Harry,"You can see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him. When we free him, I'll never have to back to the Dursley's. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.",
Harry,"You were right, Hermione, it wasn't my dad I saw earlier, it was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because...well, I’d already done it! Does that make sense?",
Harry,"Honestly Ron, how can somebody be in two places at once?",
Harry,"(Last lines) Lumos. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. [credits roll] Mischief managed. Nox. [screen goes black, ending the movie]",
Ron,"Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!",
Ron,"[Looking at tea leaves] Harry's got a sort of wonky cross, that's trials and suffering... but that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.",
Ron,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?",
Ron,"[Observing his leg after Sirius, as a dog, attacked him] It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.",
Ron,What are you trying do to him?! [Sirius snatches Scabbers from Ron] Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?,
Hermoine,[while looking at a past version of herself using the time turner] Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?,
Hermoine,"[To Malfoy] You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!",
Hermoine,"[To Sirius] If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us, too!",
Hermoine,"[To Harry] Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who've meddled with time. We can't be seen.",

And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight, more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns, should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck.",
Sirius,"No, only one will die tonight.",
Sirius,I DID MY WAITING!!! TWELVE YEARS OF IT!!! IN AZKABAN!!!,

Sirius,[to Snape] Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set.,

Cornelius Fudge,Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew... he destroyed him!,
Aunt Marge," Do they use the cane at St. Brutus', boy?",
Harry," [catching Uncle Vernon's eye] Oh yeah, yeah, I've been beaten loads of times.",
Aunt Marge," Excellent. I won't hear any of this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not beating someone when they deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out, Vernon. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it that the boy's father did, Petunia?",
Petunia," Oh, nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.",
Aunt Marge," And a drunk too, no doubt?",
Harry, [irritated] That's a lie!,
Aunt Marge, What did you say?,
Harry, [getting angry] My dad wasn't a drunk!,
Aunt Marge," Oh, don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.",
Uncle Vernon, [to Harry] I think it's time you went to bed.,
Aunt Marge," Actually, it's nothing to do with the father, it has to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup.",
Harry, [yelling angrily at Aunt Marge with a snap] SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!,
Aunt Marge, Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- [Her finger starts to inflate.],
Uncle Vernon," [angrily, shouting at the top of his lungs at Harry] YOU BRING HER BACK!!! You bring her back now and you put her right!",
Harry," No! She deserved what she got! [Uncle Vernon furiously tries to grab Harry with a savage yell, but Harry stands up to him with his wand] Keep away from me.",
Uncle Vernon, You're not allowed to do magic outside school.,
Harry, Yeah? Try me.,
Uncle Vernon, They won't let you back now. You have nowhere to go.,
Harry, I don't care. Anywhere's better than here. [angrily leaves the house and storms off],
Ron," I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy!",
Hermione," It's a cat, Ronald; what do you expect? It's in his nature.",
Ron, A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me!,
Hermione," That's rich, coming from the owner of that smelly old shoebrush.",
Fred," You're not flashing that clipping about again, are you Ron?",
Ron, I haven't shown anyone!,

Harry, Fortuna Major.,
The Fat Lady," No, wait, wait! [Sings in a higher pitch] Ah ah ah ahhh!",
Harry, [Irritated] Fortuna Major.,
The Fat Lady," No, no, no! Wait, wait! Watch this! [Screams] Ah ah ah AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH! [The Fat Lady surreptitiously looks around to make sure nobody's watching, then smashes the glass on a pillar in the painting] Oh, amazing! Just with my voice!",
Harry, [Impatient] Fortuna Major!,
The Fat Lady," [Petulant] Yes, all right, all right, you can go in.",
Harry, [Exasperated] Thank you!,
The Fat Lady, Plebs.,
Ron," He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?",
George, Peaky?,
Fred, What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.,
George," Yeah, Ron. Let's walk you off the top of the Astronomy tower.",
Fred, And see what you look like.,
Harry, [coming to] Probably a right sight better than he normally does.,
George," Gave us a right good scare there, mate.",
Hermione," Harry, are you all right?",
Harry, [jokingly] Brilliant. [serious again] What happened?,
Ron," Well, you fell off your broom.",
Harry," [sarcastically] Oh, really? I meant the match. Who won?",
Hermione," Um... no one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore was furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them straight off.",
Ron," There's um... something else you should know about, too, Harry. When you fell, your broom, it sort of blew into the Whomping Willow and... [Holds up what's left of the destroyed handle of Harry's Nimbus 2000] ...Well.",
Harry, [looking at the Marauder's Map for the first time] Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... no. Is that really...?,

Harry, So this map shows...,
Fred, Everyone.,
Harry, Everyone?,
George, Everyone.,
Fred, Where they are...,
George, ...what they're doing...,
Fred, ...every minute...,
George, ...of every day!,
Harry, Brilliant!,
Professor Snape, Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?,
Harry, I was sleepwalking.,
Snape," How extraordinarily like your father, you are, Potter. He too was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.",
Harry," [irritated] My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would lower your wand.",
Snape, [Lowers his wand] Turn out your pockets. [Harry just stands there] [sternly] Turn out your pockets. [Harry takes out the Marauder's Map] What's this?,
Harry, Spare bit of parchment.,
Snape, Really? Open it. [Harry opens the map; Snape puts his wand on the map] Reveal your secrets. [To Harry] Read it.,
Harry," ""Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...""",
Snape, Go on.,
Harry," [amused] ""...and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.""",
Snape," Why you insolent, little--!",
Professor Lupin, Professor.,
Snape," Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?",
Lupin," [to Harry] Harry, are you all right?",
Snape," That remains to be seen. [takes the Marauder's Map] I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.",
Lupin," I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks to me as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it. [chuckles] I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. [to Harry] Harry, would you come with me, please. [to Professor Snape] Professor, good night.",
Draco Malfoy, [to Crabbe and Pike] Father said I could have the hippogriff's head. Maybe I'll donate it to the Gryffindor Common Room.,
Crabbe, Look who's here.,
Draco Malfoy, Ah! Come to see the show?,
Hermione," [furiously] You! You foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach! [holds Malfoy at wandpoint]",
Ron," Hermione, no! He's not worth it!",
Hermione, That felt good.,
Ron, [impressed] Not good. Brilliant!,
Lupin," Severus, don't be a fool.",
Sirius," He can't help it Remus, it's habit by now.",
Lupin," Sirius, be quiet.",
Sirius," Be quiet yourself, Remus!",
Snape," Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple.",
Sirius, Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set?,
Snape," [puts wand on Sirius' throat] I could do it, you know? But why deny the Dementors, when they're so longing to see you? Do I detect a flicker of fear? Ah yes, a Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness but I'll do my best!",
Harry, Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.,
Lupin, He was at school with us. we thought he was our friend!,
Harry, No. Pettigrew's dead. [to Sirius] You killed him!,
Lupin, No he didn't. I thought so too until you mention seeing Pettigrew on the map.,
Harry," The map was lying, then.",
Sirius, The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's [points to Scabbers] right there!,
Ron, Me?! He's mental!,
Sirius, Not you! You're rat!,
Ron, Scabbers has been in my family for...,
Sirius," 12 years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?",
Ron, So what?!,
Harry, All they could find left of Pettigrew was his...,
Sirius, Finger! But then the dirty coward cut it off so that everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!,
Harry," Show me. [Sirius tries to take the rat from Ron, but Ron holds onto it] Give it to him, Ron.",
Ron," What are you trying do to him? [Sirius finally gets a hold of the rat] Scabbers! Leave him alone! [tries to run toward Sirius, but Hermione holds him back] Get off him! What are you doing? Scabbers!",
Peter Pettigrew," [realizes he's not a rat anymore] Remus? S-Sirius? My old friends! [runs toward the door, but Lupin and Sirius block him] Harry! Look at you! [walks toward Harry] You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends...",
Sirius, How dare you speak to Harry?! [Pettigrew scowls and runs away from Sirius] How dare you talk about James in front of him?!,
Lupin," You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?!",
Pettigrew," I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you've done? What would you've done?",
Sirius, I would have died! [Pettigrew crawls under piano] I would have died rather than betray my friends!,
Pettigrew," [runs over to Harry, whispering to him] Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... your dad would have spared me! He would shown me mercy...!",
Sirius," Should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! [he and Lupin pull out their wands and point them and Pettigrew] Together!",
Harry, No!,
Lupin," Harry, this man is...",
Harry, I know what he is. But we'll take him up to the castle.,
Pettigrew," Bless you, boy! Bless you!",
Harry," Get off! I said we'll take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you.",
Sirius," It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it.",
Harry," Well, I just didn't think my dad would've wanted his two best friends to become killers. Besides, dead the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free.",
Pettigrew," Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them...",
Sirius," Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh!",
Ron," [to Harry and Hermione, who have just disappeared and reappeared in thin air] How did you get there? I was just talking to you there! And now you're there!",
Hermione," What's he talking about, Harry?",
Harry," I don't know. Honestly Ron, how can somebody be in two places at once?",
Draco Malfoy," God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until my father hears that Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.",
Harry," Shut up, Malfoy.",
"Draco, Crabbe, and Pike", Ooh.,
Draco," Dementor, Dementor.",
Slytherin students, Oooooooooooh!,
Lupin," Very well, Kill him. But wait one more minute Harry has the right to know why.",
Harry, (to Sirius) I know why! You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!,
Lupin," No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!",
Harry, Who was it then?!,
Sirius," Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room, right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!",
Snape, [barges in and disarms Sirius' wand] Expelliarmus!,
Draco Malfoy,Potter? [Harry turns] Is it true you fainted? [Pike pretends to swoon] I mean that you actually fainted?!,
Ron," [turning Harry away] Shove off, Malfoy!",
Harry,[To Ron] I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory. I just want to be... Look. I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why. It just did. Okay?,
Harry,"[To Ron] You're a right foul git, you that?",
Harry,"[To Draco] I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile, and cruel... and you're just pathetic.",
Harry,[On attempting to ask girls out] Why do they have to travel in packs? And how are you supposed to get one alone long enough to ask them?,
Harry,"He's back! He's back! Voldemort's back! Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him... not there!",
Harry,It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire. You bewitched Krum but...,
Ron,Bloody hell.,
Ron,Loads. According to dad. It's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.,
Ron,"Murder me, Harry.",
Ron,"[bitterly] That's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend.",
Ron,Piss off.,
Ron,"This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.",
Hermoine,"[To Harry] Go on, Harry. Harry, for goodness sake.",
Hermoine,[To Harry] I'm not an owl!,
Hermoine,"Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. ""Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey, sources report, is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.""",
Hermoine,"I won't be going alone, because believe it or not, someone's asked me! And I said yes!",
Hermoine,"[To Ron] Next time there's a ball, pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does! And not i the last resort!",
Lord Voldemort,"How fastidious you've become, Wormtail. As I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home. Could it be the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you?",
Lord Voldemort,No! The boy is everything! It cannot be done without him. And it will be done exactly as I said.,
Lord Voldemort,Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker is standing just outside the door.,
Lord Voldemort,"Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.",
Lord Voldemort,"Harry, at last!",
Lord Voldemort,Kill the spare.,
Lord Voldemort,"The other arm, Wormtail.",
Lord Voldemort,"[The Death Eaters appear] Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet, here you stand before me, as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself... disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. [He unmasks the Death Eaters one by one and as he does they fall to their knees] Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you, Lucius. [He pulls off Lucius' mask who falls to his knees]",
Lord Voldemort,"Harry. I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you, but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The Boy-Who-Lived. How lies have fed your legend, Harry! Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? Yes, shall I? It was love. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son, she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch him. It was old magic. Something I should have foreseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed. I CAN TOUCH YOU NOW! [He places his finger on Harry's forehead lightning bolt scar, and Harry immediately screams out in agony, to Voldemort's cruel delight] Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?",
Lord Voldemort,"(as he roughly releases the scythe) Pick up your wand, Potter! I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up! (Harry gets his wand) You've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes? First, we bow to each other. (he bows, Harry does not) Come on now, Harry. The niceties must be observed. Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he? I said, BOW! (uses a curse to make Harry bow) That's better, and now: Crucio! (Harry writhes on the grass in pain) Crucio! (the curse goes away) Attaboy, Harry! Your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy Muggle mother!",
Lord Voldemort,"I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you. (leans down to meet Harry's eyes) After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you, they'll speak only of how you begged for death... and I, being a merciful Lord, obliged. Get up! (Harry groans)",
Lord Voldemort,"(as he fires the Killing Curse at the tombstone; shouting) Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! I want you to look at me when I kill you! I WANT TO SEE THE LIGHT LEAVE YOUR EYES!",
Lord Voldemort,[To the onlooking Death Eaters during Priori Incantatem] Do nothing! He's mine to finish!,
Dumbledore,"Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice, between what is right and what is easy.",
Dumbledore,"I keep looking for some mistake, some sign, some clue as to why these terrible things are happening, but everytime I get close to an answer, IT SLIPS AWAY, it's maddening.",
Dumbledore,"[Enters the tent of the First Task] Welcome today, champions. Now you've waited, you've wondered, and finally, the moment has arrived. A moment only four of you can fully appreciate. [notices that it's Hermione whose shoulders he has his arm around] What are you doing here, Miss Granger?",
Dumbledore,"[In the great hall speaking to the staff and students; his eulogy for Cedric] Today... we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know, exceptionally hard-working, infinitely fair-minded, and a fierce, fierce friend. Now I believe you all have the right to know exactly how he died. (getting up) You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered, by Lord Voldemort! The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this, but not doing so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now, the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me... reminds us, that though we may come from different places, and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. The bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. You remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You remember that, and we will celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and fair and true, right to the very end.",
Sirius,"""Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig. Ever since the World Cup, the Ministry’s been intercepting more and more owls and she’s too easily recognized. We need to talk, Harry, face to face. Meet me in the Gryffindor Common Room, at one o’ clock this Saturday night. And make sure you're alone. Sirius. PS: the bird bites.""",
Sirius,"Look Harry, the death eaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet, these aren't just coincidences, Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.",
Sirius,"I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.",
Sirius,"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.",
Draco Malfoy," Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five.",
Myrtle," I was circling a blocked drain the other day. I could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion. (flirtily) Not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?",
Wormtail," Bone of the father, unwillingly given. (puts the Riddle bone in the cauldron) Flesh of the servant... willingly sacrificed. (screams in agony as he cuts off his own hand) Blood of the enemy... (as he cuts Harry's sleeve and draws blood as Harry screams in pain) forcibly taken. The Dark Lord shall rise again. (adds the blood to the cauldron; it boils and Harry screams)",
James Potter," Harry, when the connection is broken you must get to the Portkey! We can linger for a moment to give you some time but only a moment. Do you understand?",
Lily Potter," Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go! LET GO!",
Hermione Granger, Harry.,
Harry Potter, Ah.,
Hermione Granger, Harry! You alright?,
Harry Potter, Hermione! Bad dream. When did you get here?,
Hermione Granger," Just now, you?",
Harry Potter, Last night.,
Hermione Granger," Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!",
Ron Weasley, Bloody hell!,
Hermione Granger," Honestly get dressed! And don't go back to sleep. Come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast is ready.",
Harry Potter," Ron, where are we actually going?",
Ron Weasley," Don’t know. Hey, Dad! Where are we going?",
Arthur Weasley, Haven’t the foggiest!,

Lucius Malfoy," [standing below them] Well, put it this way; If it rains, you’ll be the first to know.",
Draco Malfoy, Father and I are in the Minister's box. A personal invitation from Cornelius Fudge himself!,
Lucius Malfoy," Don't boast, Draco. [nudges him with his stick] There is no need with these people. [to Harry] Do enjoy yourself won't you? While you can.",
Ginny, [pointing at a particularly showy Quidditch player] Who is that?,
Fred/George," That, sis, is the best seeker in the world!",
Everyone, KRUM!!!,
Barty Crouch Jr.," (as Mad-Eye) Alastor Moody. [Writes ""his"" name on the board] Ex-Auror... Ministry malcontent... and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, good-bye, the end. Any questions? [No one raises their hand] When it comes to the Dark Arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, who can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are?",
Hermione," Three, sir.",
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [Writes ""Unforgiveable"" on a blackboard] And they are so named?",
Hermione, Because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will...,
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [finishing her sentence] Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now, the Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I SAY DIFFERENT! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be prepared! [Seamus takes some gum out and puts it under his desk] You need to find another place to put your chewing gum besides the under-side of your desk, MR. FINNIGAN!",
Seamus Finnigan, [Whispering] No way. The old codger can see out the back of his head.,
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [Throws the piece of chalk at Seamus] AND HEAR ACROSS CLASSROOMS! So, which curse shall we see first? WEASLEY!",
Ron, [scared out of his wits] Yes?,
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Stand! Give us a curse.,
Ron," Well, my dad did tell me about one. The Imperius Curse.",
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) Oh, yeah. Your father would know all about that. Gave the Ministry a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.",
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding...under the influence of the Imperius Curse. But here's the rub," How do we sort out the liars? Another, another. [Students begin to raise their hands] Up, come on. [Neville slowly raises his hand] Longbottom, is it? [Neville lowers his hand and stands up] Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for Herbology."
Neville," [Nervously] There's the, um, the Cruciatus Curse.",
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) Correct! Correct! Come, come. [the spider comes back] Particularly nasty. The torture curse. [Aims his wand at the spider] Crucio!",
Hermione, Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him?! Stop it!,
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [Releases the spider from the curse; Walks over and places the spider on Hermione's desk] Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable curse, Miss Granger. [Hermione shakes her head] No? [Points his wand at the spider] Avada Kedavra! [The spider falls, unmarked but dead. Harry is watching from a desk across.] The Killing Curse. [looks at Harry] Only one person is known to have survived it...and he's sitting in this room.",
Olympe Maxime," It's wrong, I tell you!",
Igor Karkaroff, You French tart! Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!,
Albus Dumbledore, Quiet! I can't think!,
Karkaroff, Everything is a conspiracy theory!,
Maxime, I protest!,
Dumbledore, Harry!,
Maxime, I protest!,
Dumbledore, Harry. [Grabs him] Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?,
Harry," No, sir.",
Dumbledore, Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?,
Harry," No, sir.",
Dumbledore, You're absolutely sure?,
Harry," Yes. Yes, sir.",
Maxime, But of course he is lying!,
Barty Crouch Jr., (as Mad-Eye Moody) The hell he is! The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth-year!,
Karkaroff," You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye!",
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [threateningly] It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff. Perhaps you remember?",
Dumbledore," [enraged, walking between them] This doesn't help, Alastor! Leave this to you, Barty.",
"Barty Crouch, Sr."," The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight... a Triwizard champion.",
Minerva McGonagall," This can't go on, Albus. First the Dark Mark, now this?",
Dumbledore," What do you suggest, Minerva?",
McGonagall, Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.,
Dumbledore, You heard Barty. The rules are clear.,
McGonagall," Well, the devil with Barty - and his rules. And since when did you accommodate the Ministry?",
Severus Snape," Headmaster, I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events, perhaps we should, for the time being... let them unfold.",
McGonagall," What? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat!",
Dumbledore," I agree... with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?",
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) I can do that.,
Dumbledore," Don't let him know, though. He must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.",
Rita Skeeter, This is cozy.,
Harry, It's a broom cupboard.,
Rita," You should feel right at home then. [Forces Harry to a lower part of the cupboard] Don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?",
Harry," Oh. Uh, no.",
Rita," So tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of twelve--",
Harry, I'm fourteen. Sorry.,
Rita," About to compete against three students, not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but to have mastered spells you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?",
Harry," I-I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. [looks at the quill, which is writing on its own]",
Rita," Just ignore the quill. Then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of twelve, are you?",
Harry, [miffed] Fourteen.,
Rita, Your story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?,
Harry, I didn't enter.,
Rita," Of course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. [To the quill] Scratch that last. [the quill obeys] Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows, at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic death wish?",
Harry," [looks at the quill's notes] Hey! My eyes aren't ""glistening with the ghosts of my past""!",
Harry, Sirius. How–?,
Sirius," I don't have much time, Harry, so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?",
Harry, No!,
Sirius," Shh! I had to ask. Now tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?",
Harry, I don't know.,
Sirius, You didn't hear a name?,
Harry, No. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.,
Sirius, And what was that?,
Harry," He wanted... me. I don't know why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?",
Sirius," Yes... it's just a dream. Look, Harry, the Death Eaters at the World Cup; your name rising from that goblet; these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.",
Harry, What are you saying?,
Sirius," I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff? He was a Death Eater and no one, no one stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his own son to Azkaban.",
Harry, Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?,
Sirius," I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet, Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.",
Harry," I'm not ready for this, Sirius.",
Sirius, You don't have a choice.,
Harry, Someone's coming.,
Sirius," Keep your friends close, Harry.",
Hermione, Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid is looking for you.,
Harry, Is that right? Well... You can tell him... Wait... What?,
Hermione," [Goes back to Ron, talks to him quietly for a few seconds, then walks back] Dean was told by Parvati that... that... Please don't ask me to say it again! Hagrid is looking for you. [starts to walk away]",
Harry, Well you can tell Ronald–,
Hermione, [furiously] I'M NOT AN OWL!,
Draco Malfoy," Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five! [laughs]",
Harry," [enraged] I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile, and cruel... and you're just pathetic.",
Draco, Pathetic?! [angrily draws his wand],
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) OH NO, YOU DON'T, SONNY! [Transfigures Draco into a ferret] I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned! [Proceeds to flick the ferret up and down] You stinking...cowardly...scummy...back-shooting--",
McGonagall, Professor Moody! Wha-what are you doing?!,
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Teaching.,
McGonagall, [shocked] Is that a... Is that a student?!,
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) Technically, it's a ferret. [Proceeds to dump the ferret down Crabbe's trousers]",
Goyle," Stand still! Stand still! [Attempts to remove the ferret from Crabbe's trousers, only to be bitten]",
Draco, [Getting up] My father will hear about this!,
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Is that a threat?,
McGonnagall, Professor Moody--,
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) IS THAT A THREAT?!,
McGonnagall, Professor--,
Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) I CAN TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT YOUR FATHER THAT WILL CURL EVEN YOUR GREASY HAIR, BOY!",
McGonnagall, Alastor!,
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) IT DOESN'T END HERE!,
McGonagall," Alastor. [Moody listens] We never use Transfiguration as a punishment! Surely, Dumbledore told you that?",
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) He might've mentioned it.,
McGonagall," Well, you will do well to remember it. [She turns around, before gesturing a group of students gathered nearby to leave] Away!",
Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) You. Come with me.,
Ron, I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your name in the Goblet of Fire.,
Harry," Caught on, have you? Took you long enough.",
Ron," Well, I'm the not only who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.",
Harry, [sarcastic] Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.,
Ron, Least I warned you about the dragons.,
Harry, Hagrid warned me about the dragons.,
Ron," No, no, no. I did. No, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you, Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be all right, you know, after you'd figured that out.",
Harry, [confused] ...Who? Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.,
Ron, Yeah. Isn't it? I suppose I was a bit distraught.,
Hermione, [sadly] Boys.,
McGonagall," The house of Godric Gryffindor has been a beacon in the wizarding world for nearly ten centuries, and I will not have you besmirching it in one night by acting like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.",
George/Fred," [to each other] Try saying that five times fast. [together] Babbling, bumbling band of baboons! Babbling, bumbling band of baboons! Babbling... [Both walk off screen]",
McGonagall," [About the Yule Ball] Inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers, longing to burst forth and take flight.",
Ron," [To Seamus] Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.",
Harry," [To Fred and George]] Oi! [They lean in to him] You're never gonna let him forget this, are you?",
Both, [smug smirks on their faces] Never.,
Ron, What are those?! What are those?!,
Harry, My dress robes.,
Ron," Well, they're all right! No lace, no dodgy little collar...",
Harry," Well, I expect yours are more... traditional—",
Parvati, [Looking at Hermione] She looks beautiful!,
Harry," [Looking at Cho] Yeah, she does... Wha– [Turns around and sees Hermione coming down the stairs. Noticing how beautiful she really looks, he smiles gently, agreeing with Parvati]",
Dumstrang Boy, [To Parvati] May I have your arm?,
Parvati, [looks back at Harry then says to the boy] Arm? Leg? I'm yours! [goes to dance with him],
Ron, [about Krum] He’s using you.,
Hermione," How dare you! Besides, I can take care of myself.",
Ron," Doubt it, he’s way too old.",
Hermione, What? Is that what you think?,
Ron," Yeah, that’s what I think!",
Hermione," [on the verge of tears] You know the solution then, don’t you?",
Ron, Go on.,
Hermione," Next time there’s a ball, pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort!",
Ron, Well... that-that-that... that’s just completely off the point. [sees Harry approaching] Harry.,
Hermione," Where have you been? Never mind. Off to bed, both of you!",
Ron, They get scary when they get older.,
Hermione," Ron, you spoiled EVERYTHING!! [Breaks down in tears on the stairs]",
Harry, I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.,
Hermione," [catching on his meaning] Wouldn't know, we don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.",
Hermione," [desperately trying to recover] I just mean he's not particularly loquacious. [Harry looks at her in amusement] Mostly, he watches me study. It's a bit annoying, actually.",
Seamus, What's the matter with him?,
Dean, I don't know. I can't see him.,
Neville[horrified], Oh my God! I've killed Harry Potter!,
Fleur Delacour," You saved her, even though she was not yours to save. My little sister. Thank you! [kisses Harry on both cheeks before turning to Ron] And you, you helped.",
Ron," Yeah, yeah, a bit. [Fleur kisses Ron on both cheeks as well before checking on her little sister] Merci.",
Hermione," Personally, I believe you behaved admirably.",
Harry," I finished last, Hermione.",
Hermione," Next to last. Fleur never got past ""ze Grindylows.""",
Bartemius Crouch Sr.," Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this council. Should your testimony prove consequential, Council may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain, in the eyes of the Ministry, a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms?",
Igor Karkaroff," I do, sir.",
Bartemius Crouch Sr., And what do you wish to present?,
Igor Karkaroff," I have names, sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.",
Bartemius Crouch Sr., Mr. Rosier is dead.,
Igor Karkaroff, Dead?,
Alastor Moody," [to Dumbledore] Yeah, he took a piece of me with him, though, didn't he?",
Igor Karkaroff, I didn't know.,
Bartemius Crouch Sr., If that is all the witness has to offer...,
Igor Karkaroff," No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.",
Bartemius Crouch Sr., Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?,
Igor Karkaroff," Ya ya, the same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.",
Bartemius Crouch Sr.," Very well, the council will deliberate. In the meantime you will return to Azkaban.",
Igor Karkaroff," NO! WAIT! WAIT! PLEASE! PLEASE!. I have more! What about Snape, Severus Snape?",
Dumbledore," The council is very much aware of given evidence to this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater, and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.",
Igor Karkaroff, [with demented fury] It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!,
Bartemius Crouch Sr.," Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence, this session is now concluded.",
Igor Karkaroff," Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I heard about one more.",
Bartemius Crouch Sr., What's that?,
Igor Karkaroff, The name...,
Bartemius Crouch Sr., Yes?,
Igor Karkaroff," I know for a fact that this person took part in the capture, and by means of the Cruciatus curse, torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife...",
Bartemius Crouch Sr., The name. Give me the wretched name!,
Igor Karkaroff," Barty Crouch! [Rita Skeeter gasps, pause] Junior.",
Barty Crouch Jr.," Get your filthy hands off of me, you pathetic little men! [He is brought before his father] Hello, father. [flicks his tongue]",
Bartemius Crouch Sr., [visibly hurt] You are no son of mine.,
Severus Snape," A rather rare herb, gillyweed. Not something found in your everyday garden. Nor is this. [He faces Harry and holds up a small bottle of a clear liquid] Know what it is?",
Harry," Bubble juice, sir?",
Harry, I haven't stolen anything.,
Snape," Don't... lie to me. Gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies? You and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me, I'm going to find out why!",
Voldemort," [to the Death Eaters] Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet, here you stand as if it were only yesterday. I confess myself... disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. [angrily starts ripping off their masks] Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you, Lucius.",
Lucius Malfoy," My Lord, had I detected any sign; a whisper of your whereabouts--",
Voldemort," Oh, there were signs, my slippery friend, and more than whispers!",
Lucius Malfoy," I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways! The face I have been obliged to present since your... absence – that is my true mask.",
James Potter," Harry, when the connection is broken you must get to the Portkey! We can linger for a moment to give you some time but only a moment. Do you understand?",
Cedric Diggory," Harry. Take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my father.",
Lily Potter," Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go... LET GO!",
Cornelius Fudge, For God sake's Dumbledore what's happened?!,
Harry," [Crying over Cedric's body] He's back! He's back! Voldemort's back! Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him... not there!",
Dumbledore," It's all right, Harry...it's all right. He's home, you both are.",
Cornelius Fudge," [rushing over to Snape and McGonagall] Keep everybody in their seats. A boy’s just been killed. The body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.",
Amos Diggory," [Pushing his way frantically through the crowd] Let me through. LET ME THROUGH! Let me through, THAT'S MY SON! That's my boy! [pushes Harry's hands away and leans over Cedric's body, sobbing hysterically] IT'S MY BOY!!!!",
Barty Crouch Jr.," (as Mad-Eye) [mocking Hagrid] ""Marvelous creatures, Dragons, aren't they"". Do you think that miserable oaf would've sent you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater if I hadn't told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder, could've provided you with Gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book that led him straight to it? HUH?! [Points to head with finger, as if to say, ""Use your brain""]",
Harry, It was you from the beginning! You put my name into the Goblet of Fire! You bewitched Krum! But--,
Barty Crouch Jr.," (as Mad-Eye) [Mocking] ""Bu-bu-bu-bu"". You won because I made it so, Potter. You ended up in that graveyard because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. [Grabs Harry's bleeding arm] The blood that runs in your veins runs within the Dark Lord! Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter!",
Dumbledore," You alright, Alastor?",
Moody," I'm sorry, Albus.",
Harry, If that's Moody then who's–,
Snape, Polyjuice Potion.,
Dumbledore," Now we know who's been stealing it from your store, Severus.",
Dumbledore, Barty Crouch Jr.,
Barty Crouch Jr., I'll show you mine if you show me yours. [He reveals the Death-Eater symbol on his wrist],
Dumbledore," Your arm, Harry. [shows the scar on Harry's wrist – where Wormtail took his blood to revive Voldemort –is shown]",
Barty Crouch Jr.," You know what this means, don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.",
Dumbledore, [to Snape] Send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.,
Barty Crouch Jr., [smugly] I'll be welcomed back like a hero!,
Dumbledore," Perhaps. Personally, I've never had much time for heroes.",
Ron, Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?,
Harry and Hermione, No!,
Ron," Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh well, what's life without a few dragons?",
Hermione," Everything's going to change now, isn't it?",
Harry, Yes.,
Hermione," Promise you'll write this summer, both of you.",
Ron," Oh, I won't. You know I won't.",
Hermione," Harry will, won't you?",
Harry," Yeah, every week.",
Harry,"[Addressing Dumbledore's Army] Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself. Think of it this way; every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us?",
Harry,"[after Dumbledore announced Umbridge the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, whispering to Hermione] She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.",
Rubeus Hagrid," It’s changin’ out there. There’s a storm comin’, ‘arry... just like last time. And we'd all best be ready when she does.",
Sybill Trelawney," [goes into a trance, makes a prediction] The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not... For neither can live while the other s-survives.",
Kingsley Shacklebolt," You may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny", Dumbledore's got style.
Harry, Where are we going? The letter said I had been expelled from Hogwarts.,
Moody," Well, you haven't been. Not yet. [to Shacklebolt] Kingsley, you take point.",
Harry, But the letter said--,
Kingsley, [interrupting Harry] Dumbledore has persuaded the Minister to suspend your expulsion pending a formal hearing.,
Harry, A hearing?,
Kingsley, Uh-huh.,
Tonks," Don't worry, Harry. we'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.",
Moody," Sshh! Not here, Nymphadora!",
Tonks, [her hair turns red and then back to her original color] Don't call me Nymphadora!,
Moody, Stay in formation everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed!,
Sirius," If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly!",
Molly," He's not an adult either. He's not James, Sirius.",
Sirius, He's not your son.,
Molly, He's as good as. Who else has he got?,
Harry," Hey, Ginny.",
Sirius, He's got me!,
Snape," How touching and paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.",
Sirius," Now you stay out of this, Snivellus.",
Harry, Snape's part of the Order?,
Ron, Git.,
Sirius, I don't care what Dumbledore says about your supposed reformation. I know better.,
Snape, Why don't you tell him? Or are you afraid he won't take serious the word of a man hiding in his mother's house?,
Ron," Hermione, I hate your cat.",
Hermione, Bad Crookshanks!,
Arthur," This is very, very peculiar. It seems that your hearing at the Minstry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.",
Harry," I don't understand, what's the Ministry of Magic got against me?",
Moody, Show him. He'll find out soon enough.,
Sirius," He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet, to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.",
Harry, Why?,
Lupin, The Minister thinks Dumbledore's after his job.,
Harry, But that's insane. No one in their right mind could believe that Dumbledore--,
Lupin," Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power, he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned and I'm afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing that terrifying truth.",
Sirius," We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. [everyone turns to face Sirius] Fourteen years ago he had huge numbers at his command, not only witches and wizards but all sorts of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. [Moody lets out a loud cough] We believe Voldemort may be after something else--",
Moody, Sirius--,
Sirius, Something he didn't have last time.,
Harry," You mean, a weapon?",
Molly, No! That's enough! He's just a boy! You tell him much more and you might as well induct him in the Order straight away!,
Harry," Good! I want to join! If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight!",
Dumbledore," Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian... Dumbledore.",
Fudge," You, you got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you?",
Dumbledore," I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. [Pause] The charges?",
Fudge," The charges against the accused are as follows; that he did knowingly and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, produced a Patronus charm in the presence of a Muggle. Do you deny producing said Patronus?",
Harry," No, I--",
Fudge, [interrupting Harry] And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?,
Harry," Yes, but--",
Fudge, Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--,
Harry, I was only doing it because of the Dementors!,
Amelia Bones, Dementors? In Little Whinging?,
Fudge," That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they boy? Highly convenient.",
Harry, I'm not lying! There were two of them and if I hadn't--,
Fudge," [Interrupting Harry again] Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well rehearsed story, but since you can produce no witnesses of the event--",
Dumbledore," Pardon me Minister, but as it happens, we can.",
Amelia Bones, Please describe the attack. What did they look like?,
Mrs. Figg," Well one of them was very large, and the other rather skinny.",
Fudge," Not the boys, the Dementors!",
Mrs. Figg," Alright, right, well um, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold, as though all the happiness had gone from the world.",
Fudge," Now look here, Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb and happen across a wizard, the odds are astronomical.",
Dumbledore," I don't think anyone would believe the Dementors were there by coincidence, Minister.",
Umbridge," [clears her throat] I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor. Dementors are after all under the control of the Ministry of Magic. So silly of me but it sounded, for a moment, as though you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.",
Dumbledore," That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Undersecretary, which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry into why the two Dementors were so far away from Azkaban and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence of the Dark Lord's return is incontrovertible.",
Fudge, He's not back!,
Dumbledore," In the matter of Harry Potter, the law clearly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.",
Fudge," Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore!",
Dumbledore," Clearly, it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of under-age magic.",
Amelia Bones, Those in favor of conviction? [Fudge raises his hand followed by some other people including Umbridge] Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?,
Fudge, [reluctantly; as he bangs his gavel] Cleared of all charges.,
Harry, [sees a strange reptilian-like thestrals] What is it?,
Ron, What's what?,
Harry, That. Pulling the carriage.,
Hermione," Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself like always.",
Luna," You're not going mad. [lowers her magazine, The Quibbler, which she has been reading upside down] I see them too. You're just as sane as I am.",
Umbridge," Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me. [No one smiles] I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.",
Fred and George, [sarcastically] That's likely.,
Umbridge," The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizard of vital importance. Although each Headmaster has brought something new to this historic school... [nods to Dumbledore] progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.",
Dumbledore," Thank you Professor Umbridge, that really was most illuminating.",
Ron, Illuminating? What a load o' waffle!,
Harry," Dean, Seamus, good holiday?",
Dean," Alright, better than Seamus' anyway.",
Seamus, Me mam didn't want me to come back this year.,
Harry, Why not?,
Seamus," [sarcastically] Let me see, eh, because of you! The Daily Prophet's been sayin’ a lot of things about ya, Harry. And about Dumbledore as well.",
Harry," What, your mum believes them?",
Seamus," Well, nobody was there the night Cedric died.",
Harry," [increasingly angry] Oh, well, I guess you should read the Prophet then, like your stupid mother, it'll tell you everything you need to know!",
Seamus, Don't you dare talk about my mother like that!,
Harry, I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar!,
Ron, [entering the Common Room] What's going on?,
Seamus," He's mad, is what's goin’ on! Do you believe the rubbish he's comin’ out with about You-Know-Who?",
Ron," Yeah, I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? [Harry has stormed into the boys' dorm - Ron hot on his tail - and is starting to get ready for bed] You alright?",
Harry, Fine.,
Ron," Seamus was bang out of order, mate. But he'll come through. You'll see--",
Harry," I said I'm fine, Ron!",
Ron, [taken aback] Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts then. [leaves the dormitory],
Harry, So why can't the others see them?,
Luna, They can only be seen by people who've seen death.,
Harry, So... you've known someone who's died?,
Luna," My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment, and one day one of her spells went badly wrong. I was nine.",
Harry, I'm sorry.,
Luna," Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and you fought him and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you and Dumbledore.",
Harry, Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.,
Luna, I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.,
Harry, What do you mean?,
Luna," Well, if I were You-Know-Who, I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone, you're not as much of a threat.",
Umbridge," Your previous instruction for this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you will be pleased to know, from now on you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic. [Hermione raises her hand] Yes?",
Hermione, There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.,
Umbridge, Using spells? [laughs] Why I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.,
Ron, We're not gonna use magic?,
Umbridge, You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure risk-free way.,
Harry," Well, what use is that? If we're gonna be attacked, it won't be risk-free.",
Umbridge," Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. [pauses] It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient to get you through your examinations, which after all is what school is all about!",
Harry, And how’s theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?,
Umbridge," There is nothing out there, dear. Who would you imagine would want to attack children like yourself?",
Harry," [sarcastically] Oh, I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort!",
Umbridge, Now let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark Wizard is at large once again. This... is... a... lie!,
Harry, It's not a lie! I saw him! I fought him!,
Umbridge," DETENTION, Mr. Potter!",
Harry, So according to you Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord.,
Umbridge, Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.,
Harry, [angrily] It was murder! Voldemort killed him! You must know!,
Umbridge," ENOUGH! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. [giggles]",
Hermione, What's wrong with your hand?,
Harry, Nothing. [shows her his right hand],
Hermione," Your other hand. [grabs his left arm, and sees his scars from Umbridge's detention] [horrified] You've got to tell Dumbledore!",
Harry," No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.",
Ron," Bloody hell, Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this-!",
Harry," Yeah, well, I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?",
Hermione," Harry, you've got to report this. It's perfectly simple - you're being-",
Harry," No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this, it's not simple. You don't understand.",
Hermione, [frustrated] Then help us to.,
Umbridge," Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?",
Professor McGonagall," I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students, you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.",
Umbridge," So silly of me but it sounds as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom, Minerva.",
Professor McGonagall," Not at all, Dolores. Merely your medieval methods.",
Umbridge," I am sorry dear, but to question my practices is to question the Ministry and, by extension, the Minister himself. I am a tolerant woman, but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.",
Professor McGonagall, Disloyalty?,
Umbridge, Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action.,
Umbridge," [during an inspection] So, you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?",
Snape, Yes.,
Umbridge, But you were unsuccessful?,
Snape, [annoyed] Obviously.,
Trelawney, [in tears] Sixteen years I've lived and taught here! Hogwarts is my home! You can't do this!,
Umbridge," [shows the Order of Dismissal to Trelawney with faux sympathy] Actually, I can. [McGonagall arrives and tries to comfort Trelawney] [to McGonagall] Something you'd like to say, dear?",
McGonagall," Oh, there are several things I would like to say!",
Dumbledore," [arrives] Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?",
McGonagall," [to Trelawney] Sybil, dear, this way...",
Trelawney," [shakes Dumbledore's hand] Oh, thank you! Thank you!",
Umbridge," Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms of Educational Decree #23, as enacted by the Minister...",
Dumbledore," [warningly] You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds - That power remains with the headmaster.",
Umbridge, For now.,
Dumbledore, [turns around to the students and speaks sternly] Don't you all have studying to do?,
Harry, First we need to find a place to practice where Umbridge won't find out.,
Ginny, The Shrieking Shack?,
Harry, It's too small.,
Hermione, Forbidden Forest?,
Ron, Not bloody likely!,
Ginny, Harry? What happens if Umbridge does find out?,
Hermione," Who cares? I mean, sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?",
Ron," [pleasantly surprised] Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?",
Hermione," You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.",
Ron, The what?,
Hermione," It's also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it, and is always equipped for the seeker's needs.",
Ron," So, say you really needed the toilet...?",
Hermione," Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's the idea.",
Harry, It's brilliant! It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.,
Hermione, Um... Hi! You all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.,
Zacharias, Why?,
Ron," Why. Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.",
Zacharias, [nods toward Harry] So he says.,
Hermione, So Dumbledore says.,
Zacharias," So Dumbledore says because he says! The point is, where's the proof?",
Boy, If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...,
Harry," I'm not going to talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here you might as well clear out now. [aside to Hermione] C'mon, Hermione, let's go. They're just here because they think I'm some sort of freak.",
Hermione," Harry, wait!",
Luna, Is it true you can produce a Patronus charm?,
Hermione, Yes. I've seen it.,
Dean," Blimey, Harry! I didn't know you could do that!",
Neville," And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.",
Ginny, It's true.,
Ron, Third year he fought off about a hundred dementors at once.,
Hermione, And last year he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.,
Harry," Wait... look, it all sounds great when you say it like that. But the truth is most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I nearly always had help...",
Hermione, He's just being modest.,
Harry," No, Hermione, I'm not! Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake you can just try again tomorrow. But out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes... you don't know what that's like.",
Hermione," You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're having any chance against beating... Voldemort.",
Nigel, He's really back?,
Ron," Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.",
Hermione," [sarcastically] Thanks, Ronald.",
Fred, One Sickle.,
George, You're on.,
Fred, Thank you.,
George, Shut up.,
[Ron gets up; walks to Fred and George]," I let her do that. It’s good manners, isn’t it?",
Harry, Are you alright? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.,
Cho," Yeah, I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, just learning all this. Makes me wonder whether if he'd known it...",
Harry," Cedric, Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better.",
Cho," You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. [Mistletoe magically appears above Cho and Harry] Mistletoe.",
Harry," Probably full of Nargles, though.",
Cho, What are Nargles?,
Harry, No idea.,
Hermione," [referring to Harry's kiss] Well, how was it?",
Harry," Wet. Well, she was sort of... crying.",
Ron," That bad at it, are you?",
Hermione, I'm sure Harry's kissing is more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days.,
Ron, Think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.,
Hermione," Don't you understand how she must be feeling? [Ron and Harry just stare at her] Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him. Conflicted because Umbridge is threatening to sack her mother from her job at the Ministry and frightened of failing her O.W.L.'s because she's so busy worrying about everything else.",
Ron," [after a long pause] One person couldn't feel all that, they'd explode!",
Hermione, Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... [laughs],
Dumbledore," In the dream were you standing next to the victim, or looking down at the scene?",
Harry," Neither, I--It was like I--Professor, will you please just tell me what's happening?",
Dumbledore, Everard! Arthur is on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people.,
Harry, Sir...,
Dumbledore," Phineas! You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured and his children will be arriving there soon, by Portkey.",
Everard," They got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. Once more the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.",
Dumbledore," Oh, thank goodness! Next we need to--",
Harry, [enraged] LOOK AT ME! [Dumbledore finally faces Harry] What's happening to me?,
Snape," [Entering Dumbledore's office] You wished to see me, Headmaster?",
Dumbledore, Oh Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise we'll all be vulnerable.,
Snape," It appears there is a connection between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is for the moment unclear. Pray he remains ignorant.",
Harry," You mean if he knows about it then, he'll be able to read my mind?",
Snape," Read it, control it, unhinge it. In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them literally begging for death would he finally kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself! Legilimens! [Series of flashbacks] Concentrate, Potter. Focus.",
Harry," [to Sirius] This connection between me and Voldemort, what if the reason for it is that I'm becoming more like him? [starts to choke up; fighting back tears] I just feel so... angry, all the time. And what if after everything I've been through, something's gone wrong inside me. What if I'm becoming bad?",
Sirius," I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. You understand? [Harry nods] Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We have all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on. That's who we really are.",
Hagrid, Dumbledore sent me to parlay with the giants.,
Hermione, Giants?! You found them?,
Hagrid," Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, you see.",
Neville," [talking to Harry alone] Fourteen years ago, a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information, but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.",
Harry," We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.",
Umbridge," I've been watching them for weeks and see, Dumbledore's Army. Proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. [to Dumbledore] All your fear mongering about You-Know-Who never fooled us for a minute. We see your lies for what they were, a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.",
Dumbledore, Naturally.,
Harry," No, professor! He had nothing to do with it, it was me!",
Dumbledore," Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as it's been pointed out the parchment clearly says ""Dumbledore's Army"", not ""Potter's"". I instructed Harry to form this organization and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.",
Fudge," Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry we can still make the front page. Dawlish, Shacklebolt! You will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban, to await trial for conspiracy and sedition...",
Dumbledore," Ah, I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion I am going to - what was the phrase, ""Come quietly""? Well I can tell you this", I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
Umbridge, Enough of this! Take him!,
Kingsley," Whoo! You may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny - Dumbledore's got style! [Fudge gives Kingsley a WTF look]",
Ron, You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.,
Hermione," Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.",
Ron," Yeah, we talked you into it...",
Harry," Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is made things worse. Anyway, it doesn't matter anymore, because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much - The more you care, the more you have to lose. Maybe, it's just best to...",
Hermione, To what?,
Harry, To go it alone.,
Snape, Feeling sentimental?,
Harry, That's private.,
Snape," Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant.",
Harry, Don't say a word against my father.,
Snape, Weak!,
Harry, I'm not weak!,
Snape, Then prove it! Control your emotions! Discipline your mind! Legilimens!,
Harry (In Memory), Sirius.,
Snape, I may vomit.,
Harry, Stop it!,
Snape, Is that what you call control?,
Harry, [heavy panting] We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest!,
Snape," The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind, sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that, in fact he frequently saw to it!",
Harry, My father was a great man!,
Snape, Your father was a swine. Legilimens!,
Harry, Protego!,
"James ""Prongs"" Potter"," Come on, Moony! Padfoot! Snape! [points his wand at Snape] Expelliarmus!",
"Sirius ""Padfoot"" Black III"," Nice one, James!",
Young Marauder," Come on, James, finish him off!",
Harry Potter, [shocked] Dad?,
"James ""Prongs"" Potter"," Impedimenta! (Hogwartians start to chant ""Snivellus! Greasy! Snivellus! Greasy!"") [smirks] Right, who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?",
Snape, Enough. [grabs Harry by his shirt] Your lessons are at an end.,
Harry, I didn't mean--,
Snape, Get. Out.,
Voldemort, I need that prophecy.,
Sirius, You'll have to kill me.,
Voldemort," Oh I will, but first you will fetch it for me. Crucio! Crucio!",
Harry, [to Ron and Hermione] Alert the Order if you can.,
Ron, Are you mental? We're going with you!,
Harry, It's too dangerous.,
Hermione, When are you going to get it into your head?! We're in this together!,
Umbridge, [Catching them] That you are!,
Snape," You sent for me, Headmistress?",
Umbridge," Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether they want to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum?",
Snape," I'm afraid you used up all my stores, interrogating students. The last of it on Ms. Chang. Unless you wish to poison him - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy if you did - I cannot help you. [turns to leave]",
Harry, [to Snape; desperately] He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.,
Umbridge," Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape?",
Snape, No idea. [leaves without another word],
Umbridge," Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is a matter of Ministry Security, you leave me with... no other alternative. The Cruiciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.",
Hermione, That's illegal.,
Umbridge, [Putting a picture of Fudge face down] What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. [prepares to curse Harry],
Hermione," Tell her, Harry!",
Umbridge, Tell me what?,
Hermione," Well, if you won't tell her where it is, I will.",
Umbridge, Where what is?,
Hermione, Dumbledore's secret weapon.,
Umbridge," You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. [A centaur takes out an arrow and places in on his bow] Lower your weapons! I warn you! Under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence-- [The centaur fires its arrow] Protego! [makes a shield and the arrow falls on the ground] How dare you! Filthy halfbreed! Incarcerous!",
Hermione," Please, please stop it! Please!",
Umbridge," NO, ENOUGH! I will have order! [Umbridge is picked up by Grawpy] YOU FILTHY ANIMAL! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!",
Hermione, [To the centaurs] Leave him alone! It's not his fault! He doesn't understand!,
Umbridge," Potter, do something! Tell them I mean no harm!",
Harry," I'm sorry, Professor. But I must not tell lies.",
Umbridge, [as the centaurs carry her away] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge! LET... ME... GOOOOOOOOOOO!,
Hermione," Thank you, Grawp.",
Hermione," [Running up with Harry to meet Ginny, Ron, Neville and Luna] How did you get away?",
Ginny," Puking Pastilles, it wasn't pretty.",
Ron, I told them I was hungry and wanted some sweets. Of course they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.,
Hermione," [surprised] That was clever, Ron!",
Ron, [smiles] It's been known to happen.,
Neville," It was brilliant. So, how are we getting to London?",
Harry," Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you. But, I've got you into enough trouble as it is.",
Neville, Dumbledore's Army was supposed to be about doing something real. Or was all that just words to you?,
Ron," Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.",
Harry," So, how are we going to get to London?",
Luna," We fly, of course.",
Harry, Where's Sirius?,
Lucius Malfoy," You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams and reality. You only saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now hand me the prophecy.",
Harry, You do anything to us and I'll break it.,
Bellatrix Lestrange," [laughs] He knows how to play! Itty, bitty, baby, Potter!",
Bellatrix Lestrange, Neville Longbottom is it? How's mum and dad?,
Neville, Better. [points wand] now they're about to be avenged!,
Lucius Malfoy, All we want is that prophecy.,
Harry, Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?,
Bellatrix Lestrange, You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood!,
Lucius Malfoy," It's alright, he's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. [whispers] Haven't you always wondered what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you, when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do, is give it to me, and I can show you everything.",
Harry, I waited 14 years.,
Lucius Malfoy, [in mock sympathy] I know.,
Harry, Guess I can wait a little longer. NOW!,
"Harry, Ron, Neville, Ginny, Hermione, and Luna", STUPEFY!,
Lucius Malfoy," Did you actually believe, or were you truly naive enough to think that children stood a chance, against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now, or watch your friends die.",
Neville," Don't give it to him, Harry!",
Bellatrix Lestrange, Sst!,
Sirius, Get away from my godson. [punches Lucius],
Bellatrix Lestrange, [Laughing] I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me?!,
Harry, CRUCIO!,
Voldemort," [Inside Harry's head] You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. [Voldemort appears behind Harry] Do it! [Harry turns around and is easily disarmed by Voldemort] So weak!",
Dumbledore," It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way.",
Voldemort, By which time I shall be gone. And you... shall be dead.,
Harry," [While being possessed by Voldemort] You... you've lost, old man!",
Dumbledore, Harry.,
Voldemort, So weak! So vulnerable! Look at me!,
Dumbledore," Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not! [Pause] Harry.",
Harry,"You're the weak one. And you'll never know love, or friendship. And I feel sorry for you.",
Voldemort," You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything!",
Fudge, He's back!,
Dumbledore, I know how you feel Harry.,
Harry, No you don't. It's my fault.,
Dumbledore," No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year, he'd be less tempted and therefore you might be more protected.",
Harry, The prophecy said, neither one can live for the other one survives. It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other... in the end?
Dumbledore, Yes.,
Harry, Why didn't you tell me?,
Dumbledore," For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. For the same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you suffered, I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you.",
Harry, How come you're not at the feast?,
Luna, Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.,
Harry, That's awful.,
Luna," Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. [holds Harry's hand for a few seconds, then releases it]",
Harry, Are you sure you don't want any help looking?,
Luna," That's alright. Anyway, my mum always said, things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end... [They see shoes hanging at the ceiling] if not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding.",
Harry, I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.,
Hermione, What's that?,
Harry," That even though we got a fight ahead of us, we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.",
Ron, Yeah?,
Harry, Something worth fighting for.,
Harry,"[after Dumbledore asks him if he has feelings for Hermione] Oh no, no, no, I mean she's brilliant, but we're friends.",
Harry,I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's... it's the place to be tonight!,
Harry,[After witnessing Dumbledore's murder] Snape! He trusted you!,
Dumbledore,"Years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.",
Dumbledore,Being me has its privileges.,
Dumbledore,"Now as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight and you have the right to know why. Once there was a young man, who like you, sat in this very hall, walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roofs. He seemed to all the world a student like any other. His name: Tom Riddle. [Murmuring erupts among the students] Today, of course, he's known all over the world by another name, which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact: Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. [pause] But in the end, their greatest weapon... is you. There's something to think about. Now off to bed, pip pip.",
Draco Malfoy,"Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! [Harry falls, still hidden] Oh, right. She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. [Kicks Harry in the face, breaking his nose] That's for my father. [Covers Harry with the cloak] Enjoy your trip back to London.",
Horace Slughorn,"[in regard to returning to Hogwarts] All right, I'll do it! But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise, these are mad times we live in. MAD!",
Horace Slughorn,"[Telling Harry the story of his deceased fish] It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk with just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. Just before it reached the bottom, it was transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day the bowl was empty, was the day your mother... I know why you're here, but I can't help you. It would ruin me.",
Professor McGonagall," Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.",
Arthur Weasley," Times like these, dark times, they do funny things to people. They can tear them apart.",
Luna Lovegood," I've never been to this part of the castle. Well, not when I'm awake. I sleep-walk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed.",
Katie Bell," I know you're going to ask Harry, but I don't know who cursed me. I’ve been trying to remember, honestly. But I just can’t.",
Muggle Waitress, Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?,
Harry," No one, bit of a tosser really.",
Muggle Waitress," Funny that paper of yours, a couple minutes ago I could have sworn I saw a picture move. Thought I was going 'round a twist.",
Harry," Hey, I was wondering--",
Muggle Waitress, 11. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.,
Harry," I just Apparated, didn't I?",
Dumbledore, Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit their first time.,
Harry, Can't imagine why...,
Dumbledore," You are, of course, wondering why it is I have brought you here tonight.",
Harry," Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sorta go with it.",
Slughorn," Merlin's Beard! No need to disfigure me, Albus.",
Dumbledore," I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.",
Slughorn, It's all in the upholstery. [pats his stomach] I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?,
Dumbledore, [points to stains in room] Dragon's blood.,
Dumbledore," So what's with all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't by any chance waiting for someone else, were you?",
Slughorn," Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean... Oh alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year, you know what that's like? You can only say no to these people so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.",
Ron, How much for this?,
Fred and George, Five Galleons.,
Ron, How much for me?,
Fred and George, Five Galleons.,
Ron, I'm your brother!,
Fred and George, Ten Galleons.,
Harry," Sorry I made you miss the carriages by the way, Luna.",
Luna, That's alright. It was like being with a friend.,
Harry," Oh, I am your friend, Luna.",
Luna, That's nice.,
Luna," [regarding Harry's broken nose] Would you like me to fix that for you? I think you look a little devil-may-care this way, but it's up to you...",
Harry, Um... have you fixed a nose before?,
Luna," No, but I've done several toes. How different are they, really?",
Harry," ...Okay, yeah, sure, give it a go.",
Luna, Episkey!,
Harry, Augh...!,
Harry, Well? How do I look?,
Luna, Exceptionally ordinary.,
Harry, ...Brilliant.,
Ron, [to Hermione and Ginny] Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute. [starts eating],
Hermione, [smacks him on the arm with a book] Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing!,
Ron," Oi. Turn around, you lunatic!",
Ginny, He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood?,
Ron, Looks like it's his own this time.,
Dumbledore," I'm like you, Tom. I'm different.",
Tom Riddle - Age 11, Prove it.,
Dumbledore," I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.",
Harry," Did you know, sir? Then?",
Dumbledore, Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.,
Slughorn," What about you, Miss Granger? What do your parents do in the Muggle world?",
Hermione, My parents are dentists. [Everyone except Harry looks at her in confusion] They tend to people's teeth.,
Slughorn, Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?,
Hermione," No... Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches.",
Harry," What brings you here, sir?",
Slughorn," [good-naturedly/drunkenly] Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back! Farther back than I care to admit! Ho ho ho... Why I can remember when it was just ONE Broomstick! [Slughorn chuckles and spills his drink all over the table, splashing Hermione; she jumps away] Whoops! All hands on deck, there, Granger!",
McGonagall," [to Harry, Ron, and Hermione] Why is it, whenever something happens, it is always you three?",
Ron," Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years.",
Harry, It was Malfoy.,
McGonagall," That is a very serious accusation, Potter!",
Snape, Indeed. Your evidence?,
Harry, I just know.,
Snape," You just know? [pause] Once again you astonish with your gifts Potter, gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be... to be the Chosen One.",
Ron, [about Ginny and Dean] What is it he sees in her?,
Harry, She's smart... funny... attractive...,
Ron, Attractive?,
Harry, Well you know... she has nice... skin.,
Ron, Skin. So you think Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?,
Harry," Well, no, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.",
Ron," Hermione's got nice skin. You know, as skin goes, I mean.",
Harry," I-I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. [long pause] ...I think I'll be going to sleep now.",
Slughorn," Some of your classmates... well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.",
Harry," Shelf, sir?",
Slughorn," Anyone who aspires to be anyone ends up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?",
Harry," Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? [Slughorn freezes] You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.",
Slughorn, Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst he was here at Hogwarts.,
Harry," What was he like? [no response] I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents.",
Slughorn," I... of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.",
Hermione, [To Harry] You really shouldn't have done it.,
Harry, I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.,
Hermione," That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game. [Harry takes the vial of Felix Felicis out of his shirt pocket and shows it to Hermione, who looks at it in confusion] You didn't put it in. Ron only thought you did.",
Hermione, [Tearfully] Charms spell. I'm just practicing.,
Harry," Well, they're really good. [sits down]",
Hermione," How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend.",
Lavender, Oops! I think this room's taken! [runs off],
Ron, What's with the birds?,
Hermione, Oppugno.,
Harry, It feels like this.,
Hermione, [about Romilda Vane] She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.,
Harry," But I am the Chosen One. [Hermione hits on the head with a rolled up newspaper.] Sorry, um, kidding.",
Waiter, Dragon Tartare?,
Hermione," No, I’m fine, thank you.",
Waiter," Probably just as well, they give one horrible breath.",
Hermione," On second thoughts... [Grabs tray and gobbles one] Maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay... oh God, here he comes!",
Harry, I think she just went to powder her nose.,
McLaggen," Slippery little minx your friend is. Likes to work her mouth, too, doesn’t she?",
McLaggen," What is this I'm eating, by the way?",
Harry, [tentative] Dragon Balls.,
Snape," [pause] You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen - [Harry tries to leave] not... so quick, Potter!",
Harry," Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...",
Snape," Can surely survive another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message.",
Harry, Message?,
Snape," From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holiday. You see, he’s traveling, and he won’t return until term resumes.",
Harry, Traveling where?,
Ginny," [taking a mince pie from the plate on her lap] Open up, you. [Smiling broadly as he looks surprised] Don't you trust me? [she feeds him the mince pie]",
Harry, It's good...,
Ron," [as he is sitting down] Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah. [Offering the platter] Pie?",
Harry," [curtly] Not for me, no.",
Ginny, Has Ron gone to bed?,
Harry," Um... [looks upstairs] not yet, no.",
Ginny," [indicating his feet] Shoelace. [Harry bends down to re-tie his shoelaces, but Ginny gets there first. When she has finished, she straightens up and moves closer to him.] Merry Christmas, Harry.",
Harry, Merry Christmas.,
Slughorn," [To Tom] I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. [Someone in Tom's gang laughs]",
Tom Riddle - Age 16," Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?",
Slughorn," Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite. But how did you know?",
Tom Riddle - Age 16, Intuition.,
Slughorn," Good gracious, is it that time, already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. [Everyone but Tom leaves. Tom taps the hourglass, and Slughorn notices Tom is still there] Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom?",
Tom Riddle - Age 16," Yes, sir. You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand.",
Slughorn, Go on.,
Tom Riddle - Age 16," I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic, and I thought, perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... [He makes an unintelligible sound and Slughorn stares in bewilderment.]",
Slughorn," I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Now get out of here at once AND DON'T EVER LET ME CATCH YOU MENTIONING IT AGAIN! [The memory becomes cloudy and ends]",
Ginny," Close your eyes. That way you can’t be tempted. [she hides the Half-Blood Prince's book, then kisses Harry] That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.",
Ron," So, did you and Ginny do it, then?",
Harry, [alarmed] What?,
Ron," You know, hide the book?",
Harry, Oh... yeah.,
Lavender, [noticing Hermione at Ron's side in the Hospital Wing] What's she doing here!?,
Hermione, I might ask you the same question!,
Lavender, I happen to be his girlfriend!,
Hermione, I happen to be his... friend.,
Lavender, Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks! I suppose you want to make up now that he's suddenly all interesting!,
Hermione," He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.",
Lavender," Ah! See? He senses my presence. [leans down] Don't worry, Won-Won! I'm here. I'm here.",
Ron, [croaks] Uh... Hermione... Her... my... nee. Hermione...,
Dumbledore," [jovially] Oh, to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away everyone... Mr. Weasley is well tended.",
Ginny," [whispering to Harry] About time, too. Don't you think?",
Harry, [To Madam Pomfrey as she puts something on Ron's bedside table] Thank you.,
Hermione," [noticing Harry's expression] Oh, shut up.",
Slughorn," [Gasps in surprise] Merlin's beard, Harry!",
Harry," Oh, sorry, sir, I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout!",
Slughorn," Yes, I did actually! ...What made you think that?",
Harry," Oh, well, just the general behavior, sir - the sneaking around, jumping when you saw me... Are those tentacular leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?",
Slughorn," Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer! ...Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course.",
Harry," Personally, these plants always kind of freak me out.",
Slughorn," Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!",
Harry," That would be counter-productive, sir!",
Slughorn, What makes you say that?,
Harry, No idea.,
Harry," I'm going to tell you something - something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One, only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office, and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, sir. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise the bowl will remain empty, forever.",
Slughorn," Please... don't think badly of me when you see it. You've no idea how he was like, even then. [Withdraws memory]",
Tom Riddle - Age 16," [approaching Slughorn] I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux.",
Slughorn, I beg your pardon?,
Tom Riddle - Age 16, A Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.,
Slughorn," I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark indeed.",
Tom Riddle - Age 16, Which is why I came to you.,
Slughorn, [Stares at Tom for a second] A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.,
Tom Riddle - Age 16," But I don't understand how that works, sir.",
Slughorn," One splits ones soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.",
Tom Riddle - Age 16, Protected?,
Slughorn," That part of your soul that is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die.",
Tom Riddle - Age 16," [Looks into the fireplace] And how does one split his soul, sir?",
Slughorn," I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.",
Tom Riddle - Age 16, Murder.,
Slughorn, Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It's a violation against nature.,
Tom Riddle - Age 16," [Adjusting ring on his finger, the same one in present day Dumbledore's office] Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...",
Slughorn," Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?",
Tom Riddle - Age 16," [Smiling] Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret.",
Dumbledore," Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine, spring evening?",
Malfoy, Who else is here? I heard you talking.,
Dumbledore," I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you been whispering to you yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin.",
Malfoy, How do you know what I am?! I've done things that would shock you!,
Dumbledore," Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that, in return, she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco, but I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak that your heart can't really have been in them.",
Malfoy, He trusts me! I was chosen! [reveals the Dark Mark on his left arm],
Dumbledore, I shall make it easy for you... [raises his wand],
Malfoy, Expelliarmus!,
Dumbledore," [wand flies out of his hand] Very good, very good. [door opens in the distance] You're not alone? There are others? How?",
Malfoy, The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it.,
Dumbledore, Let me guess; It has a sister? A twin?,
Malfoy, At Borgin & Burke's. They form a passage.,
Dumbledore," Ingenius. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.",
Malfoy, [breaking into tears] I don't want your help! Don't you understand? I have to do this! I have to kill you! Or he's gonna kill me...,
Bellatrix," [walking into the astronomy tower followed by Death Eaters] Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco!",
Dumbledore," Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order, don't you think?",
Bellatrix," Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule. [to Draco] Do it!",
Greyback, He doesn't have the stomach... just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way.,
Bellatrix," No! The Dark Lord was clear; The boy's to do it. This is your moment. Do it! Go on, Draco! NOW!",
Snape, No. [steps in],
Dumbledore, Severus... please.,
Snape, Avada Kedavra!,
Harry," Incarcerous! [Snape blocks the spell] Fight back! You coward, fight back!",
Snape, No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!,
Harry, Sectumsempra!,
Snape," You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? [Harry stares in horror] Yes. I'm the Half-Blood Prince. [Kicks Harry's wand away and leaves]",
McGonagall," Potter... In light of what has happened. If you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know, Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him.",
Hermione, Do you think he would've done it? Draco.,
Harry," No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. [Harry gives the locket to Hermione] It's fake. Open it.",
Hermione," [opens the locket and reads the message] ""To the Dark Lord"," I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B."" R.A.B.?"
Harry," Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it.",
Hermione," Ron's okay with it, you know. You and Ginny. If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum.",
Harry," I'm not coming back, Hermione. I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll lead me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can.",
Hermione," I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.",
Harry," Just do me a favor. When I’m around, keep the snogging to a minimum, please.",
Hermione," [chuckles] Like that’s going to happen. Besides, he’s barking.",
Harry," Funny, he says the same thing about you.",
Hermione," Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive.",
Harry, [chuckles] You’re brilliant. You’re both brilliant. I never realized how beautiful this place was.,
Harry,"[Referring to Voldemort] The longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.",
Harry,"I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already.",
Harry,"[last lines, about Dobby] I want to bury him. Properly, without magic.",
Ron,[Referring to Hermione] We won't last two days without her. [pause] Don't tell her I said that.,
Ron,[after barely managing to destroy a horcrux] Just think. Only three more to go.,
Ron,[About Xenophilius] That treacherous little bleeder! Is there no one we can trust?,
Hermoine,"If Voldemort really has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.",
Hermoine,Actually I'm highly logical which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.,
Hermoine,"Forest of Dean. I came here once with Mum and Dad. That was years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees, the river, everything. Like nothing's changed... not true of course. Everything's changed. If I brought them back here now, they'd probably not recognize any of it. Not the trees, not the river... not even me. [Pause] Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old... [Another pause] You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. I know. Gellert Grindlewald. [Hands Harry The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]",

Hermoine,"[Reading the Tale of the Three Brothers] ""There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road, at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass, but being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. Before they could cross, however, they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. It was Death, and he felt cheated. Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river, but Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence, so Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby. The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave, so Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. The first brother traveled to a distant village. While with the Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him, he bragged of his invincibility. But that night, another wizard stole the wand and slit the brother's throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own. The second brother journeyed to his home, where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother. As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals.""",
Voldemort,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.",
Voldemort,"To those of you who do not know. We are joined tonight by Ms. Charity Burbage, who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle Studies. It is Ms. Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination, but something to be encouraged.",
Rufus Scrimgeour," [First lines] These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.

Luna Lovegood, [to her father] Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.,

Xenophilius Lovegood," [draws a line] The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. [draws a circle] The Resurrection Stone. [draws a triangle] The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of death.",
Fred and George Weasley, [after each taking a potion to make them look like Harry] Wow! We're identical!,
Voldemort," Severus. I was beginning to worry that you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news, I trust?",
Snape," It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.",
Yaxley," I heard differently, my Lord. Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the 30th of this month, the day before he turns 17.",
Snape, This is a false trail. The Auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.,
Voldemort," What say you, Pius?",
Pius," One hears many things my Lord, and if the truth is among them is not clear.",
Voldemort," Ha! Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.",
Moody," Potter, you're underage, which means you still have the Trace on you.",
Harry, What's the Trace?,
Moody," If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is, we'll have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect"," Brooms, Thestrals, and the like; we'll go in pairs. That way if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be... they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
Harry, The real one?,
Moody, [brings out Polyjuice Potion] I reckon that you're familiar with this particular brew.,
Harry," [recognizes it; sarcastically] No, absolutely not.",
Hermione, Told you he'd take it well.,
Moody," For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning", It tastes like goblin piss.
Fred," Have lots of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? ...Just trying to diffuse the tension.",
Shacklebolt, [pointing his wand at Lupin] The last words that Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?,
Lupin," ""Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.""",
Fred," [walking into burrow and seeing the injured George] How you feeling, Georgie?",
George, [quietly] Saint-like.,
Fred, [confused pause] Come again?,
George," Saint-like. I'm holy... [Points to spot where his ear is missing] I’m holey, Fred. Get it?",
Fred," [laughs quietly] The whole wide world of ear-related humor, and you go for, ""I'm holy""? That’s pathetic.",
George, Reckon I'm still better looking than you.,
Lupin, [Holding Harry up against the wall of the burrow at wandpoint] What creature sat in the corner the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?,
Harry, ARE YOU MAD?,
Lupin, WHAT CREATURE!?,
Harry, A-A Grindylow!,
Lupin, [releases Harry] We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you're not an impostor.,
Shacklebolt, What gave you away?,
Harry," Hedwig, I think. She was tryna protect me.",
Ginny," [while Harry zips her dress up] Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on.",
Harry, Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.,
George, [after Ginny spots him and stopped kissing Harry] Morning.,
Hermione," Right. Remember what we said, don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary. Just, try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing. If we do that then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside. Then...",
Harry, It gets really tricky.,
Hermione, Correct.,
Harry, This is completely mental.,
Hermione, Completely.,
Ron," The world's mental. Come on, we've got a Horcrux to find.",
Ron, [as Cattermole] Morning.,
Harry," [as Runcorn] Ron, it's me.",
Ron," [as Cattermole] Harry! Blimey, forgot what you look like. Where's Hermione?",
Harry," [as Runcorn] She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge.",
Ron," [as Cattermole] Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs.",
Harry," [as Runcorn] Ron, you don't have a wife.",
Ron," [as Cattermole] Oh, right.",
Yaxley, Cattermole. It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now.,
Ron, [as Cattermole] Have you tried an umbrella?,
Umbridge, Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?,
Mary, Yes?,
Umbridge," A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. [holds up said wand] Is this that wand? [She nods] Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?",
Mary," I didn't take it! I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivanders, when I was 11. It chose me!",
Umbridge," You're lying. Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.",
Mary," But I am! [To Ron, as Reg] Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am! [Ron is silent] Reg, tell them what I am.",
Umbridge," What on earth are you doing, Albert?",
Harry," [as Runcorn] You're lying, Dolores... [Umbridge looks shocked, and Hermione tenses up] And one mustn't tell lies. Stupefy!",
Harry, There's just one problem.,
Ron," The sword was stolen. [Walks up, turns the lamp back on with his Deluminator. Ron has a stony look on his face. The locket/horcrux around his neck is affecting him greatly] Yeah. I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil your fun.",
Harry, What's wrong?,
Ron," Well, nothing's wrong. Not according to you, anyway.",
Harry," Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.",
Ron," All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful just because now there's another damn thing we've gotta find.",
Harry, I thought you knew what you signed up for!,
Ron," Yeah. I thought I did, too.",
Harry," Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we were gonna be staying in a five-star hotel? Finding a Horcrux every other day? You thought you'd be back with your mum by Christmas?",
Ron, I just thought after all this time we would have actually achieved something! I thought you knew what you were doing! I thought Dumbledore would've told you something worthwhile! I thought you had a plan!,
Harry," I told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already.",
Ron," [bitterly] Yeah and we're about as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we?",
Hermione," [trying to intervene] Ron, please. [She tries to take the locket off of Ron, but he angrily shoves her away] Please take the Horcrux off! You won't be saying any of this if you hadn't been wearing it all day!",
Ron," You don't know why I listen to that radio every night, do you? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum...",
Harry," What, you think I'm not listening too? YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS FEELS?!",
Ron," NO, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS! Your parents are dead! You have no family!",
Hermione, Stop! Stop! [pulls the boys apart],
Harry," FINE THEN, GO!!! GO THEN!",
Hermione, Ron...,
Ron M, [turns to Hermione] And you? Are you coming or are you staying? [Hermione looks torn; she glances from Harry to Ron in shock] Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.,
Hermione," [tears in her eyes] Ron, that's; that's nothing!",
Hermione, [upon arriving at Godric's Hollow] We should have taken Polyjuice potion.,
Harry, No... this is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.,
Harry, How did you find us?,
Ron," [takes out the deluminator] With this. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning, I was sleeping in this little pub, keeping away from some Snatchers, and I heard it.",
Harry," ""It""?",
Ron," A voice. Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of it.",
Hermione," And what exactly did I say, may I ask?",
Ron," My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. And sure enough, it floated towards me, the ball of light, right through my chest and straight through me. Right here. [he touches his heart] And I knew it was going to take me where I needed to go.",
Ron, How long do you think she'll stay mad at me?,
Harry," Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.",
Ron," It was true, every word. This is gonna sound crazy, but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator. I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me.",
Harry," You're not still mad at him, are you?",
Hermione, I'm always mad at him.,
Luna Lovegood," [takes his hand] Whenever you're ready, Sir.",
Dobby the House Elf," ""Sir""? I like her very much.",
Bellatrix Lestrange, How dare you defy your master!,
Dobby the House Elf," Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!",
Bellatrix Lestrange, You stupid elf! You could have killed me!,
Dobby the House Elf," Dobby never meant to kill! Dobby only meant to maim, or seriously injure!",
Ron,[About Griphook] That little git. Least we've still got Bogrod. [Bogrod gets incinerated by the dragon] That's unfortunate.,
Ron,"That's my girlfriend, you numpties!",
Ron,Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!,
Ron,"[about saving Malfoy] If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna KILL YOU!",
Voldemort,"[to Nagini, speaking in Parseltongue] The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. It makes us vulnerable. We must deploy all our forces now to find him. And you, my friend, must stay close.",
Voldemort,[watching as Hogwarts is protected by spells] They never learn. Pity.,
Voldemort,"[to all of Hogwarts] I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think that to fight is wise. But this is folly. Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have one hour.",
Voldemort,"[to all of Hogwarts] You have fought valiantly, but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you. On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you, rather than face me yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest, and confront your fate. If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.",
Voldemort,"Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived... come to die. [pause] Avada Kedavra!",

Molly Weasley," [in anger towards Bellatrix] NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!",
Ollivander," He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true what you say and he (Voldemort) has found the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.",
Harry Potter," I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then.",
Hermione Granger," [disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange, addressing a Death Eater] Good morning!",
Griphook ," ""Good morning?"" ""Good morning?"" You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewey-eyed schoolgirl!",
Ron Weasley, Oi! Easy!,
Hermione," No, he's right. I was being stupid.",
Harry Potter," He knows. You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts, he knows what we took, and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.",
Hermione Granger, How is it you know?,
Harry Potter, I saw him.,
Hermione Granger," You let him in? Harry, you can't do that!",
Harry Potter," Hermione, I can't always help it! Well, maybe I can, I don't know.",
Ron Weasley, Never mind; what happened?,
Harry Potter," Well, he's angry, and he's scared too. He knows if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.",
Hermione Granger, What? You saw it?,
Harry Potter," I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. They must have something to do with her. We have to go there, now.",
Hermione Granger," What? We can't do that! We've got to plan, we've got to figure it out...",
Harry Potter," Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.",
Ron Weasley, He's right. One problem. Snape's headmaster now; we can't just walk in through the front door.,
Harry Potter," Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade, to Honeyduke's. Take the secret passage in the cellar. It's... There's something wrong with him. It's like, you know, in the past, I've always been able to follow his thoughts. And now, everything just feels disconnected.",
Ron Weasley, Maybe it's the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker; maybe he's dying.,
Harry Potter," No. No, it's...it's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.",
Aberforth Dumbledore," Bloody fools, what were you thinking coming here? Have you any idea of how dangerous it is?",
Harry Potter," You’re Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. It's you that I've been seeing in here. You're the one who sent Dobby.",
Aberforth Dumbledore, Where have you left him?,
Harry Potter, He's dead.,
Aberforth Dumbledore, Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.,
Harry Potter, Who gave that to you? The mirror?,
Aberforth Dumbledore, Mundungus Fletcher. About a year ago.,
Harry Potter, Dung had no right sending it to you. It belongs to...,
Aberforth Dumbledore," Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out that I had it, but ask yourself", where would you be if I didn't? [Gives the trio some food]
Hermione Granger, Do you hear from the others much? From the Order?,
Aberforth Dumbledore, The Order's finished. You-Know-Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.,
Harry Potter," We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.",
Aberforth Dumbledore, Did he now? Nice job? Easy?,
Harry Potter," We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's inside the castle, but we'll need your help in getting in.",
Aberforth Dumbledore," It's not a job my brother's given you. It's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor, boy, and go home. Live a little longer.",
Harry Potter, Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.,
Aberforth Dumbledore," What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers? [referring to the portrait of Ariana on the wall]",
Harry Potter, Why should he...,
Aberforth Dumbledore," ...Keep secrets, you tell me?",
Harry Potter, I trusted him.,
Aberforth Dumbledore," That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell you where to start. You're lying! Not just to me, it doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does. You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter. So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason.",
Harry Potter, I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother. I don't care that you've given up. I trusted the man I knew. We need to get into the castle tonight.,
Aberforth Dumbledore, [motions toward Ariana’s portrait] You know what to do.,
Ginny Weasley, [sees Harry] Harry!,
Harry Potter, Hi there.,
Ron Weasley," Six months she hasn't see me, it's like I'm a Frankie First Year. I'm only her brother...",
Seamus Finnigan," She's got lots of those, though. There’s only one Harry.",
Ron Weasley," Shut up, Seamus.",
Neville Longbottom," [to Ginny] What is it, Ginny?",
Ginny Weasley, Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.,
Neville Longbottom," Right then, so what's the plan, Harry?",
Harry Potter," Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.",
Neville Longbottom," Right, what is it?",
Harry Potter, We don't know.,
Dean Thomas, Where is it?,
Harry Potter, We don't know that either. I realize that's not much to go on.,
Seamus Finnigan, That's nothin’ to go on.,
Professor Snape," [to Hogwarts students] Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour. It's come to my attention that earlier this evening, Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished, in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events... who fails to come forward, will be treated... as... equally guilty. If anyone here knows any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward... now.",
Harry Potter," [coldly] It seems despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster. [Order of Phoenix members enter] And I'm afraid it's quite extensive. How dare you stand where he stood. Tell them how it happened that night! How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him! Tell them!",
Minerva McGonagall, Coward!,
Pansy Parkinson, [after a long silence] What are you waiting for? Someone grab him!,
Argus Filch, [running in with Mrs. Norris; yelling] Students out of bed! STUDENTS OUT OF BED! Students in the corridor!,
Minerva McGonagall," [snapping] They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!",
Argus Filch," Oh. Sorry, ma'am.",
Minerva McGonagall," As it happens, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I would like you, please, to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall! [motions with her wand]",
Argus Filch," Exactly where is it I'll be leading ‘em to, ma'am?",
Minerva McGonagall, The dungeons would do.,
Minerva McGonagall," I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?",
Harry Potter," Time, Professor. As much as you can get me.",
Minerva McGonagall," Do what you have to do. I’ll secure the castle. [as Harry turns to leave] And Potter, it’s good to see you.",
Harry Potter," It’s good to see you, too, Professor. [leaves]",
Harry Potter, [to Neville]," Hold the fort, Neville."
Neville Longbottom," Let me get this straight, Professor. [grabs her arm] You're actually giving us permission to do this?",
Minerva McGonagall," That is correct, Longbottom.",
Neville Longbottom, To blow it up? Boom?,
Minerva McGonagall, BOOM!,
Neville Longbottom, [laughing] Wicked. But how on earth are we gonna do that?,
Minerva McGonagall," Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.",
Seamus Finnigan, [nodding] I can bring it down.,
Minerva McGonagall, That's the spirit. Off you go.,
Filius Flitwick," You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.",
Minerva McGonagall," That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it. He's going to try to kill you either way.",
Remus Lupin," It is the quality of one’s convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.",
Kingsley Shacklebolt, Who said that?,
Remus Lupin, Me.,
George Weasley," You okay, Freddie?",
Fred Weasley, Yeah.,
George Weasley, Me too.,
Luna Lovegood," Harry, wait, I need to talk to you.",
Harry Potter," I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.",
Luna Lovegood," You won't find it where you're going, you're wasting your time.",
Harry Potter," We'll talk later, okay, Luna?",
Luna Lovegood, Harry!,
Harry Potter, Later!,
Luna Lovegood," [shouting] Harry Potter! You listen to me right now! [calmer] Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There's not a person alive who's seen it. It's obvious, isn't it? You have to talk to someone who's dead.",
Harry Potter, You're the Grey Lady. The Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.,
Helena Ravenclaw, I do not answer to that name.,
Harry Potter," No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter.",
Helena Ravenclaw, Are you a friend of Luna's?,
Harry Potter, Yes. And she thought you might be able to help me.,
Helena Ravenclaw, You seek my mother's diadem.,
Harry Potter, Yes. That's right.,
Helena Ravenclaw," Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others. But she was wrong. I cannot help you.",
Harry Potter," Wait! Please! I want to destroy it. [pause] That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed.",
Helena Ravenclaw, Another swore to destroy it many years ago... a strange boy with a strange name.,
Harry Potter, Tom Riddle.,
Helena Ravenclaw, But he lied.,
Harry Potter, He's lied to many people.,
Helena Ravenclaw, I know what he's done! I know who he is! HE DEFILED IT WITH DARK MAGIC!,
Harry Potter," I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You do know where he hid it, don't you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please.",
Helena Ravenclaw," Strange. You remind me of him a bit. It's here, in the castle, in the place where everything is hidden. If you have to ask, you will never know. If you know, you need only ask.",
Harry Potter, Thank you.,
Draco Malfoy," [points his wand at Harry] Well, well. What brings you here, Potter?",
Harry Potter, Might ask you the same.,
Draco Malfoy, You have something of mine. I'd like it back.,
Harry Potter," [Nudging to his wand] Well, what's wrong with the one you have?",
Draco Malfoy," It's my mother's, it's powerful but it's... not the same. It doesn't quite... understand. You know what I mean?",
Harry Potter, Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix? You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.,
Gregory Goyle," C'mon Draco, don't be a prat, do it.",
Lucius Malfoy," My Lord, might it be less... Might it not be more prudent to call off this attack? Simply seek the boy yourself?",
Lord Voldemort," I do not need to seek the boy. Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand?! [slaps his face] Look at me! How can you live with yourself, Lucius?",
Lucius Malfoy, I... I don't know.,
Lord Voldemort, Go and find Severus. Bring him to me.,
Severus Snape," You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord, in the last few hours alone.",
Lord Voldemort," No. No, I am extraordinary, but the wand... resists me.",
Severus Snape," There is no wand more powerful, Ollivander himself has said. Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you, I am sure of it. It answers to you, and you only.",
Lord Voldemort, Does it?,
Severus Snape, My Lord...,
Lord Voldemort," The wand, does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Surely, you must know. Where does its true loyalty lie?",
Severus Snape," With you, of course, my Lord.",
Lord Voldemort," The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine. You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus, but only I can live...forever.",
Severus Snape, My Lord... [Voldemort slashes with his wand and cuts Snape's throat; blood spills; Severus falls onto the window],
Lord Voldemort," Nagini, kill. [Nagini repeatedly bites Snape, mortally wounding him]",
Severus Snape," It will contain the curse to your hand for the time being. It will spread, Albus.",
Albus Dumbledore, How long?,
Severus Snape, Maybe a year.,
Albus Dumbledore," Don't ignore me, Severus. We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, one should presume that the Dark Lord would turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely. [We see Dumbledore being killed by Snape, as shown in Half-Blood Prince] There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something, but you must wait until Lord Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.",
Severus Snape, Must be told what?,
Albus Dumbledore," On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing that it could find", Harry himself. There is a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There is a reason he can look into Voldemort's mind. A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
Severus Snape," So, when the time comes...the boy must die?",
Albus Dumbledore," Yes, yes, he must die.",
Severus Snape, You've kept him alive so he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter!,
Albus Dumbledore," Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy. [Snape casts a deer Patronus, the same one that helped Harry find the Sword of Gryffindor in Part 1] Lily? [A crying Snape is shown holding Lily's body] After all this time?",
Severus Snape," Always. So, when the time comes...the boy must die?",
Albus Dumbledore," Yes, he must die. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.",
Harry Potter," [Walking into a clearing in the Forest, Harry pulls the Snitch from his pocket] I'm ready to die. [He kisses it, and it opens to reveal a small black stone] The Resurrection Stone...",
Lily Potter," You've been so brave, sweetheart.",
Harry Potter," Why are you here, all of you?",
Lily Potter, We never left.,
Harry Potter," Does it hurt, dying?",
Sirius Black, Quicker than falling asleep.,
James Potter," You're nearly there, son.",
Harry Potter," I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...",
Remus Lupin," Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand.",
Harry Potter, You'll stay with me?,
James Potter, Until the end.,
Harry Potter, And he won't be able to see you?,
Sirius Black," No. [points to Harry's heart] We're here, you see.",
Harry Potter, Stay close to me.,
Lily Potter, Always.,
Albus Dumbledore," Harry, you wonderful boy. You brave man. Let us walk.",
Harry Potter," Professor, what is that?",
Albus Dumbledore," Something beyond either of our help. A part of Voldemort, sent here to die.",
Harry Potter, And exactly where are we?,
Albus Dumbledore, I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?,
Harry Potter," Well, it looks like King's Cross Station, only cleaner, and without all the trains.",
Albus Dumbledore," King's Cross, is that right? This is, as they say, your party. I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate, since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.",
Harry Potter," So it's true then, isn't it, Sir? A part of him lives in me, doesn't it?",
Albus Dumbledore," Did. It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself. You were the Horcrux he never meant to make, Harry.",
Harry Potter," I have to go back, haven't I?",
Albus Dumbledore," Oh, that's up to you.",
Harry Potter, I have a choice?,
Albus Dumbledore," Oh, yes. We're in King's Cross, you say? I think if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.",
Harry Potter, And where would it take me?,
Albus Dumbledore, [chuckles] On.,
Harry Potter, Voldemort has the Elder Wand.,
Albus Dumbledore, True.,
Harry Potter, And the snake's still alive.,
Albus Dumbledore, Yes.,
Harry Potter, And I've nothing to kill it with.,
Albus Dumbledore," [walks back to Harry] Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry, to those who ask for it. I've always prized myself on my ability to turn a phrase. Words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it. But I would, in this case, amend my original statement to this"," ""Help would always be given at Hogwarts to those who deserve it."" Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living. And above all, those who live without love."
Harry Potter," Professor, my mother's Patronus was a doe, wasn't it? It's the same as Professor Snape's. It's curious, don't you think?",
Albus Dumbledore," Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all. I'll be going now, Harry. [turns to leave]",
Harry Potter, Professor? Is this all real? Or is it just happening inside my head?,
Albus Dumbledore," Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean that it's not real? [he fades into the light]",
Harry Potter," Professor, what shall I do? Professor?",
Bellatrix Lestrange, The boy... is he dead?,
Narcissa Malfoy," [Leaning into Harry, her eyes widen as she feels his heart still beating] Is he alive? Draco, is he alive?",
Narcissa Malfoy," [after Harry nods, she stands and faces Voldemort] Dead.",
Ginny Weasley," Who is that Hagrid's carrying? Neville, who is it?",
Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter... is dead!,
Ginny Weasley, No! NO!!,
Lord Voldemort," Silence! [fires a spell towards Ginny, causing her to back down] Stupid girl. Harry Potter is dead. [to Hogwarts' assembled] From this day forth, you put your faith... in me. [to Death Eaters] Harry Potter is dead! [He and his Death Eaters laugh] And now is the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us... or die.",
Lucius Malfoy, Draco! Draco.,
Narcissa Malfoy," Draco, come.",
Lord Voldemort," Well done, Draco. Well done. [Draco walks to his parents. Neville comes forward] Well, I must say, I hoped for better. [Death Eaters laugh] And who might you be, young man?",
Neville Longbottom, Neville Longbottom. [Death Eaters laugh],
Bellatrix Lestrange, Ha-ha!,
Lord Voldemort," Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks--",
Neville Longbottom, I'd like to say somethin’.,
Lord Voldemort," [makes a fist, but then lowers it] Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.",
Neville Longbottom, It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.,
Seamus Finnigan," Stand down, Neville.",
Neville Longbottom," People die every day. Friends, family. Yeah, we lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us, in here. [gestures to his heart] So's Fred, and Remus, Tonks... all of them. They didn't die in vain. [to Voldemort] But you will, 'cause you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us! It's not over!",
Harry Potter, Confringo!,
Bellatrix Lestrange," No! No, come back! Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!",
Harry Potter," [to Ron, Hermione, and Neville] I'll lure him into the castle! We have to kill the snake.",
Harry Potter," You were right. When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you, It will always fail you.",
Lord Voldemort, [last and final words] I killed Snape!,
Harry Potter," But what if the Wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it", TOGETHER! [throws himself and Voldemort off the roof]
Hermione Granger, Why didn't it work for him? The Elder Wand?,
Harry Potter," It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the Wand would become his, but the thing is, the Wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night at the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the Wand answered to him, until... the other night, when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.",
Ron Weasley, So that means...,
Harry Potter, ...It's mine.,
Ron Weasley, What do you reckon we should do with it?,
Hermione Granger," ""We""?",
Ron Weasley," I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world. With that, we'd be invincible.",
[Last lines of the final film],,
Albus Severus Potter," Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?",
Harry Potter," Albus Severus Potter, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin, and he was the bravest man I've ever known.",
Albus Severus Potter, But just say that I am.,
Harry Potter," Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful, young wizard. But, listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.",
Albus Severus Potter, Really?,
Harry Potter, Really. [Train whistle blows] Ready?,
Albus Severus Potter, Ready.,
