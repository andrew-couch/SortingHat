Character,Dialogue
Arthur Weasley," Morning, Weasleys."
Arthur Weasley, What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Arthur Weasley, Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Arthur Weasley," Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron’s told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
Arthur Weasley, Did you really? How’d it go? Did you—
Arthur Weasley," I mean…that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
Arthur Weasley," Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. Doesn’t miss a trick, that man."
Arthur Weasley, ‘Diaganilly.’
Arthur Weasley," Children, it’s mad in here! Let’s go outside."
Arthur Weasley, Lucius.
Arthur Weasley," We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
Arthur Weasley,1058! Come on! Come on!
Arthur Weasley," Fred, George, Percy you first!"
Arthur Weasley," After you, dear."
Aunt Petunia, He’s in there. Vernon…
Aunt Petunia," Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
Aunt Petunia," …in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
Aunt Petunia, Oh!
Colin," Hi, Harry! (flash) I’m Colin Creevy! I’m in Gryffindor, too!"
Colin," (flash) Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
Cornelius Fudge," Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry’s got to act."
Cornelius Fudge," Albus look, Hagrid’s record is against him. I’ve got to take him."
Cornelius Fudge," I’m afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
Cornelius Fudge," Come, Hagrid… Well?"
Cornelius Fudge, Good boy.
Crabbe," Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Crabbe, It’s good right? Ah… Cool!
Crabbe & Goyle, Ummm…um.
Dean Thomas, Ron? Is that your owl?
Dobby," Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
Dobby," Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
Dobby," Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
Dobby," S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho… Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo…"
Dobby," Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
Dobby," No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
Dobby, Bad Dobby!
Dobby, Baaad Dobby!
Dobby, Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby!
Dobby," Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
Dobby," The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here…ooh… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
Dobby, Ooo… er… can’t… say… argh...
Dobby," Don’t make me talk, I— Errr…"
Dobby, Bad Dobby.
Dobby, Let me go!
Dobby, Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?
Dobby," Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
Dobby, No! Ahh! Ooh…
Dobby, (Snap!)
Dobby, Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school!
Dobby," Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good. (Snap!)"
Dobby, (Snap!)
Dobby, Hello!
Dobby, Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Dobby," Indeed. Yes, sir."
Dobby, At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
Dobby," Uhuh… Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
Dobby, Uh-huh-huh… Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Dobby," Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin…uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh…"
Dobby," This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves’ enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
Dobby, Ah! I shouldn’t have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
Dobby," Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. HARRY No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
Dobby, (Snap!)
Dobby, Um-humm…
Dobby, Ahh! Oow!
Dobby, Master has given Dobby a sock!
Dobby, You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Dobby, Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
Dobby," Anything, sir!"
Draco," I’ll bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
Draco," Oh look, Potter. You’ve got yourself a girlfriend."
Draco, That’s right. And that’s not all that new this year.
Draco," You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
Draco," No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
Draco," Ha, ha!"
Draco," Ha, ha…"
Draco," ‘Enemies of the heir beware!’ You’ll be next, Mudbloods!"
Draco," All right there, Scarhead?"
Draco," Training for the ballet, Potter?"
Draco," You’ll never catch me, Potter!"
Draco," Uhh, uhhh…"
Draco," Scared, Potter?"
Draco, Everte statium!
Draco, Serpensortia!
Draco," Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
Draco, Reading?
Draco," I didn’t know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
Draco," Well, sit down. You’d never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They’re an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What’s wrong with you, Crabbe?"
Draco," You know, I’m surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn’t done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
Draco, What? You think there’s someone here who’s worse than Dumbledore?
Draco," Good one, Goyle. You’re absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he’s the Heir of Slytherin!"
Draco," You know I don’t Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this It’s been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn’t tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it’s only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it’s Granger. What’s the matter with you two? You’re acting very…odd."
Draco, Hey! Where are you going?
Dudley, Who’d want to be friends with you?
Dudley, I’ll be waiting to open the door!
Dudley, Dad! What’s going on?
Dudley," Dad, hurry up!"
Dudley, Dad!
Dumbledore, …They are not.
Dumbledore," I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
Dumbledore," Argus! Argus, I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three."
Dumbledore," She’s not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
Dumbledore," But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say…"
Dumbledore," Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
Dumbledore," We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all."
Dumbledore, There’s been another attack.
Dumbledore, It means…that our students are in great danger.
Dumbledore," The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
Dumbledore, Harry?
Dumbledore," Oh, and about time, too. He’s been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
Dumbledore," Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
Dumbledore," Hagrid. HAGRID In fact, I’d be prepared ter swear it in front o’ the Ministry of Magic!"
Dumbledore, Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Dumbledore, Yes.
Dumbledore," No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
Dumbledore," Very well, then. Off you go."
Dumbledore, Riddle! Come.
Dumbledore," It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
Dumbledore," I’m afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
Dumbledore," I understand Tom, but I’m afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
Dumbledore, Is there something you wish to tell me?
Dumbledore," Very well, then. Off you go."
Dumbledore," Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?"
Dumbledore," I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
Dumbledore," Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
Dumbledore," Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
Dumbledore," You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
Dumbledore, And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Dumbledore," Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
Dumbledore," And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
Dumbledore," I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I’m not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
Dumbledore," Not intentionally, but yes."
Dumbledore," It’s true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
Dumbledore," Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
Dumbledore, Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Dumbledore," When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley’s daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
Dumbledore," Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
Dumbledore, I beg your pardon?
Dumbledore," Oh, yes."
Dumbledore, Voldemort.
Dumbledore," Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
Dumbledore," Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
Dumbledore," Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
Filch," Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
Filch," What’s going on ‘ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you…Mrs. Norris? You’ve…murdered my cat."
Filch, I’ll kill ya… I’ll kill ya!
Filch, Ask him. It’s him who’s done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Filch, Rubbish!
Filch, My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
Filch," Caught in the act! I’ll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
Fred, Come on.
Fred, Right.
Fred," Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
Fred," This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
Fred," And not to mention, they’re dead scared that Harry’ll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
George," Go, go, go, go!"
George, Right!
George," Yeah, Mum would never know."
Ginny," Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
Ginny, Leave him alone.
Ginny," Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn’t mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you’re hurt!"
Haary, ‘Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?’
Hagrid, Harry?
Hagrid, What do you think you’re doing down ‘ere? Come on!
Hagrid," Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin’ ‘round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don’ want no one ter see you there. People’ll think you were up to no good."
Hagrid," Me? Oh, I was… um… I was lookin’ for Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent. They’re ruinin’ all the school cabbages."
Hagrid," Hello, Hermione!"
Hagrid," You’ll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I’ll leave you to it, then."
Hagrid," Wo, this calls for a specialist’s equipment. Nothin’ to do but wait’ll it stops, I’m afraid."
Hagrid," Better out than in. Who’s Ron tryin’ to curse, anyway?"
Hagrid, He did not!
Hagrid," See, the thing is, Harry, there’re some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they’re better’n everyone else because they’re what people call “pure blood.”"
Hagrid," And it’s codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn’t a wizard alive today that’s not half blood or less. More ter the point, they’ve yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can’ do. Come here… Don’t you think on it, Hermione. Don’t you think on it for one minute… eh?"
Hagrid," Blimey! Harry’s got himself a rogue Bludger! That’s been tampered with, that has!"
Hagrid, Broken? There’s no bones left!
Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn’t Harry!"
Hagrid," Well, of course you don’t, and… Oh… Oh, right. Well, I’ll, umhum. I’ll just wait outside, then."
Hagrid, Let’s get yeh out of there.
Hagrid, You can’t! You don’t understand.
Hagrid, It wasn’t him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
Hagrid, No!
Hagrid, No!
Hagrid, Aragog! Aragog!
Hagrid," Mad and hairy? You wouldn’t be talking about me now, would ya?"
Hagrid," Oh, It’s a- Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin’ to Professor Sprout, they’ve still got a bit o’ growing up to do. But, once their acne’s cleared up, we’ll be able to chop ‘em up and stew ‘em, and then we’ll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin’ after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
Hagrid," Hello, Neville!"
Hagrid, Who’s there? Hello? Hello?
Hagrid," Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn’t matter- come on inI just made a pot o’ tea."
Hagrid, I’m fine! I’m alright.
Hagrid," Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ’."
Hagrid," What you had to understand about that is— (knock, knock, knock) Quick under the cloak. Don’t say a word. Be quiet, both o’ you… Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
Hagrid, Of course! Come in! Come in.
Hagrid," Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
Hagrid, Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
Hagrid, What’re you doin’ here? Get outta my house!
Hagrid," Yeh can’ take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chance! You mark my words, there’ll be killin’s next!"
Hagrid," Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they’d have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That’s all I have to say. Oh, and someone’ll need to feed Fang while I’m away."
Hagrid," Sorry I’m late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I’d just like to say that aif it hadn’t been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o’ course, I woulduh- I’d still be you-know-where, so I- I’d just like to say ‘Thanks.’"
Hagrid, Oh!
Harry, Now you’ve done it.
Harry, But she’s bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
Harry, But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer.
Harry," I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist."
Harry, Who are you?
Harry," Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
Harry, Why don’t you sit down?
Harry," Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything."
Harry, You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
Harry," Stop, Dobby!"
Harry," Dobby, shh!"
Harry," Dobby, please stop!"
Harry," Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
Harry, Your family?
Harry, What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
Harry, Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
Harry," Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
Harry, Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Harry," Get in there, and keep quiet!"
Harry, I- I was just—
Harry, Sorry.
Harry," Yes, sir… See why I’ve got to go back? I don’t belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It’s the only place I’ve got friends!"
Harry," Well, I expect they’ve… been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?"
Harry," Give me those, now!"
Harry," Dobby, get back here!"
Harry," Dobby, please, no!"
Harry, I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
Harry, Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Harry, Ahh- ahh!
Harry, Let go of me!
Harry, Get off!
Harry, I think it’s brilliant
Harry, Hello. W-what did I do?
Harry, Raids?
Harry," Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
Harry," Oh, umm…"
Harry, Floo powder?
Harry, ‘Diaganilly.’
Harry," I’m fine, thank you. I- I was just…"
Harry, No! Please!
Harry, Hagrid!
Harry," I was lost, I— hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
Harry," Well, it’s great to see you, too!"
Harry, I definitely need to remember that one.
Harry, Thank you. Bye.
Harry, Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Harry, Let’s go.
Harry, Aah!
Harry, Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can’t we get through?
Harry, The train leaves at exactly eleven o’clock. We’ve missed it!
Harry, Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Harry," Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren’t accustomed to seeing a flying car."
Harry," Well come on, then. Let’s go lower. We need to find the train."
Harry, Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Harry, Do you hear that?
Harry, Hold on…
Harry, Wha-aahhh!
Harry, I’m trying. Your hand’s all sweaty.
Harry, I think we found the train.
Harry, Up! Up!
Harry, Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
Harry, Ahh!
Harry, Be thankful it’s not your neck.
Harry, I don’t know.
Harry, Come on! Go! Fast!
Harry," See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can’t get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn’t want me here this year."
Harry, Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
Harry, You’re doomed.
Harry," Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
Harry, Stop! Stop! Hold still!
Harry, Malfoy?
Harry," No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let’s take him to Hagrid’s."
Harry, He’ll know what to do.
Harry, Ah! Oh… Okay.
Harry," Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don’t- I don’t know exactly what it means."
Harry, What’s a Mudblood?
Harry, That’s horrible!
Harry, Not really.
Harry, What?
Harry, That voice.
Harry, Didn’t you hear it?
Harry, Spooky.
Harry, Did you hear it?
Harry, That voice.
Harry, I heard it first in Lockhart’s office. And then again just—
Harry, It’s moving. I think it’s going to kill.
Harry, Strange. I’ve never seen spiders act like that.
Harry," Oh, no… It’s Filch’s cat. It’s Mrs. Norris."
Harry, No. No.
Harry," It’s not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
Harry, When I said I wasn’t hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Harry, Strange?
Harry," Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Harry," Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
Harry," Well, maybe Ron’s right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
Harry," Well, how long will it take to make?"
Harry," A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Harry, Wood! Look out!
Harry, Thank you.
Harry," No, I think my- I think my arm’s broken."
Harry," No, not you."
Harry, Ugh!
Harry, Uh!
Harry, Dobby?
Harry, It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Harry, You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Harry, Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Harry," You’d better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
Harry, I don’t suppose you could tell me why you’re trying to kill me?
Harry, Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Harry, Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Harry," Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who’s doing it now?"
Harry," Thank you, sir."
Harry, You wish.
Harry, Rictusempra!
Harry, Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
Harry, I’m a what?
Harry," I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
Harry, What’s bad? If I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin.
Harry, You were there! You heard me!
Harry, I spoke a different language? But- I didn’t realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Harry, But I’m not… I can’t be.
Harry, I’ll see you back in the common room.
Harry, No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don’t understand!
Harry, Professor… I swear I didn’t!
Harry, Professor Dumbledore?
Harry, I… I-I was- I was just wondering if you’d put me in the right house.
Harry, You’re wrong.
Harry," Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
Harry," You don’t think it was me, Professor?"
Harry," No, sir. Nothing."
Harry," Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Harry, Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Harry, Come on. Let’s get ‘em.
Harry, Ughh!
Harry," Hermione, come out. We’ve got loads to tell you!"
Harry, Hermione? A- are you OK?
Harry," She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls… What’s this?"
Harry, Looks like Moaning Myrtle’s flooded the bathroom.
Harry, Why would I throw something at you?
Harry," But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
Harry, ‘Tom Marvolo Riddle.’
Harry, ‘My name is Harry Potter.’
Harry, ‘Can you tell me?’
Harry, Excuse me. Could you tell me what’s going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Harry, Dumbledore?
Harry, Hagrid! Haagriid!
Harry, Woah!
Harry, It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
Harry," The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Harry," W- what’s that you’ve got, Hagrid?"
Harry, And they found it. Tom Riddle’s diary is gone.
Harry, No.
Harry," We’ve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can’t believe it’s him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start."
Harry, I think it’s time to get my Dad’s old cloak out again.
Harry, What’s that for?
Harry," Hagrid, are you okay?"
Harry, Did you hear about Hermione?
Harry," Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Harry," Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
Harry, You heard what Hagrid said; ‘Follow the spiders.’
Harry, Shush!
Harry, Come on!
Harry, Don’t panic.
Harry, We’re friends of Hagrid’s. And you? Y- y-you’re Aragog aren’t you?
Harry," He’s in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it’s Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Harry, Then you’re not the monster.
Harry," Shush. But if you’re not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
Harry, But have you seen it?
Harry, What?
Harry," One, but it’s not powerful enough for all of them."
Harry, Let’s go! Arania exumai! Go!
Harry, Arania exumai!
Harry, Don’t mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Harry, Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Harry, Come on! Pull!
Harry, We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Harry," Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
Harry," Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
Harry," ‘Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent’s eye. Spiders flee before it.’ Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That’s why I can hear it speak. It’s a snake!"
Harry," Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he’s a ghost- he couldn’t die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
Harry, The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk’s reflection. ‘Spiders flee before it.’ It all fits!
Harry," Hermione’s answered that, too."
Harry," Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
Harry," Lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
Harry," Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
Harry, You’re running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
Harry, You wrote them!
Harry, Don’t even think about it.
Harry, To ask you how you died.
Harry, Who was it Myrtle?
Harry," This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry, Hesha- Hassah.
Harry," Oh, yes there is! You first."
Harry, All right. Let’s go.
Harry, Uh…thanks Myrtle.
Harry," Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Harry, It’s a snakeskin.
Harry," Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
Harry, You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I’ll go on and find Ginny!
Harry, Hesha- Hassah.
Harry," Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
Harry," Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, ‘she won’t wake?’ She’s not…?"
Harry, Are you a ghost?
Harry," She’s cold as ice. Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up! You’ve got to help me, Tom. There’s a basilisk."
Harry," Give me my wand, Tom."
Harry," Listen, we’ve got to go! We’ve got to save her!"
Harry, No. She couldn’t. She wouldn’t!
Harry, But why?
Harry," But, why did you want to meet me?"
Harry," Hagrid’s my friend! And you framed him, didn’t you?"
Harry, I’ll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Harry," Well, you haven’t finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Harry, Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Harry, You! You’re the Heir of Slytherin. You’re Voldemort.
Harry, Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Harry, He’ll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Harry, Ginny-
Harry, Ginny…
Harry," Don’t worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you’ll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn’t quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It’s alright, Ginny. It’s over. It’s just a memory."
Harry," It’s just… You see, sir I- I couldn’t help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Harry, Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
Harry, So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Harry, Because I asked it to.
Harry, Godric Gryffindor.
Harry, Don’t worry. I will be.
Harry," Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Harry, Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
Harry," Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Harry, Open it.
Harry, Just promise me something.
Harry, Never try to save my life again.
Harry," Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn’t have done it without you."
Harry," Well, there’s no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
Harry, Ron!
Harry, We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Harry, Excellent.
Harry," Hermione, are you okay?"
Harry, Come on.
Harry, I think the Slytherin common room’s this way.
Harry, I’m…
Harry, Ah- um… Reading.
Harry, Uh-huh.
Harry, You’re wrong!
Harry, Harry Potter? (gulp)
Harry, But then you must have some idea who’s behind it all.
Harry, It’s his… stomachache. Calm down.
Harry, Hair!
Harry," I can’t let you out, Hedwig. I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
Hermione, Harry! Hagrid!
Hermione," Oh, it’s so good to see you!"
Hermione, What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Hermione, Ok! Bye!
Hermione, Come on! Everyone’s been so worried.
Hermione, Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
Hermione," Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It’s also quite dangerous. The Mandrake’s cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
Hermione, Get off me!
Hermione, Immobulus!
Hermione, At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
Hermione," You okay, Ron? Say something!"
Hermione, He called me a Mudblood.
Hermione, It means “dirty blood.” Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It’s not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Hermione, Harry!
Hermione, Voice? What voice?
Hermione," Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
Hermione, ‘The Chamber of Secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.’ It’s written in blood.
Hermione," That’s why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We’d just found him when he said…"
Hermione," It’s a bit strange, isn’t it?"
Hermione," You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It’s just… strange."
Hermione," No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn’t a good sign."
Hermione," Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about…the Chamber of Secrets?"
Hermione, Muggle-borns.
Hermione, Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Hermione, Yes. Couldn’t you tell? McGonagall’s worried. All the teachers are.
Hermione," The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
Hermione, If you’re talking about Malfoy.
Hermione," I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
Hermione," Even they aren’t that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it’ll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
Hermione," Here it is. ‘The Polyjuice Potion.’ (Reading from Moste Potente Potions) ‘Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.’ RON Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we’ll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Hermione, Yes.
Hermione, Exactly. But it’s tricky. I’ve never seen a more complicated potion.
Hermione, A month.
Hermione, I know. But it’s the only plan we’ve got.
Hermione, No! Even with a proper wand it’s too risky. You could hit Harry!
Hermione, Let’s go.
Hermione, Finite incantatem!
Hermione, Are you okay?
Hermione," You will be able to, won’t you?"
Hermione, Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? RON Of course. Don’t you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he’s taught Draco how to do it.
Hermione, Maybe. We’ll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Hermione, Heh… No. No one ever comes in here.
Hermione, Moaning Myrtle.
Hermione, Moaning Myrtle.
Hermione, She’s a little sensitive.
Hermione, Do you think he’s all right?
Hermione, Oh!
Hermione, You can talk to snakes.
Hermione," No, they can’t. It’s not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
Hermione," I don’t know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There’s a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
Hermione," He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Hermione, Everything’s set. We just need a bit of who you’re changing into. HARRY Crabbe and Goyle.
Hermione, We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t burst in on us while we’re interrogating Malfoy.
Hermione," I’ve got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they’re asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
Hermione, I’ve already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode– Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I’m going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Hermione, We’ll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves… Add the hairs.
Hermione, Cheers!
Hermione, Me too.
Hermione, I- I don’t think I’m going. You go on without me!
Hermione, Just go. You’re wasting time!
Hermione, Go away!
Hermione, Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat’s hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode’s robes. Look at my face.
Hermione, It can’t be Hagrid. It just can’t be.
Hermione, Look. Hagrid’s our friend. Why don’t we just go and ask him about it?
Hermione, It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn’t a student.
Hermione," Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
Hermione, It’s good to be back! Congratulations! I can’t believe you solved it!
Hermione, Thanks.
Hermione," Oh, no!"
Justin Finch-Fletchley, What are you playing at?
Lee Jordan, Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Lee Jordan, Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Lucius Malfoy," Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Lucius Malfoy," Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name…or very foolish."
Lucius Malfoy," And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco’s told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren’t they? Let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
Lucius Malfoy," Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
Lucius Malfoy," Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they’re paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I’d say not. What’s the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it."
Lucius Malfoy, Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I’ll see you at work. DRACO See you at school.
Lucius Malfoy," Already here, Fudge? Good…"
Lucius Malfoy," Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
Lucius Malfoy," The other governors and I have decided it’s time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You’ll find all twelve signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’ve rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
Lucius Malfoy, You think so?
Lucius Malfoy, Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
Lucius Malfoy," I’ll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it’s true-- you have returned!"
Lucius Malfoy, Ridiculous!
Lucius Malfoy, How dare you?!
Lucius Malfoy," My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Lucius Malfoy, And? Who was it?
Lucius Malfoy, Ah!
Lucius Malfoy, I see.
Lucius Malfoy," Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
Lucius Malfoy," Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We’re leaving."
Lucius Malfoy, Mine? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Lucius Malfoy," You do, do you? Why don’t you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
Lucius Malfoy, Dobby?
Lucius Malfoy, What? I didn’t give. DOBBY Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
Lucius Malfoy, You’ve lost me my servant!
Lucius Malfoy, Advada.
Lucius Malfoy," Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
Madame Pomfrey, Oh!
Madame Pomfrey," Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should’ve been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…"
Madame Pomfrey," Oh, I’ll be able to, certainly. But it’ll be painful. You’re in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
Madame Pomfrey," Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
Madame Pomfrey, Put him here. What happened?
Madame Pomfrey," Who is it that the monster’s taken, Minerva?"
Marcus Flint, Quidditch practice.
Marcus Flint," Easy, Wood. I’ve got a note."
Marcus Flint, A gift from Draco’s father.
Marcus Flint, Yeah! Yeah!
Moaning Myrtle," I’m Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn’t expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh…aaaah!"
Moaning Myrtle," Ahh! Wait till you see. It’s awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
Moaning Myrtle, Aaah!
Moaning Myrtle," Hee, ha, ha!"
Moaning Myrtle," Ha, ha, ha!"
Moaning Myrtle," Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huh– huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
Moaning Myrtle," Don’t ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me."
Moaning Myrtle, Sure! Let’s all throw books at Myrtle because she can’t feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Moaning Myrtle," I don’t know, I didn’t see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo…"
Moaning Myrtle," Oh! Who’s there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
Moaning Myrtle," Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
Moaning Myrtle," I don’t know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh…But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… I died. HARRY Just like that? How?"
Moaning Myrtle," I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo…"
Moaning Myrtle," Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you’re welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
Mrs. Weasley," Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear."
Mrs. Weasley," Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That’s it. There we go."
Mrs. Weasley, Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Mrs. Weasley, Morning Arthur!
Mrs. Weasley, This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Mrs. Weasley, Arthur!
Mrs. Weasley," Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
Mrs. Weasley," Oh, no."
Mrs. Weasley, We’ll manage. There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Mrs. Weasley," Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
Mrs. Weasley," Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it’s done. Yes. In you go… That’s it."
Mrs. Weasley," You see? It’s quite easy, dear. Don’t be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That’s it, mind your head. That’s right. Now take your Floo powder. That’s it, very good. Now, don’t forget to speak very, very clearly."
Mrs. Weasley," What did he say, dear?"
Mrs. Weasley, I thought he did.
Mrs. Weasley," Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We’d hoped you’d only gone one grate too far…"
Mrs. Weasley, Ah! Here he is!
Mrs. Weasley," Harry, now you give me those, and I’ll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That’s it, Ron."
Mrs. Weasley, The train will be leaving any moment!
Mrs. Weasley, Okay.
Mrs. Weasley," Come on, Ginny, we’ll get you a seat. Hurry!"
Mrs. Weasley," RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER’S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Thhhhbt!"
Neville, Uhh…
Neville," Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
Neville, Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah!
Neville," Hey, get me down!"
Neville, Why is it always me?
Neville," Harry- I don’t know who did it, but you’d better come! Come on!"
Neville, Harry- it’s Hermione!
Percy, Errol…
Percy," Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well."
Percy," Hello, Sir Nicholas!"
Percy, Excuse me.
Percy," I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
Percy," Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
Professor Lockhart, It can’t be- Harry Potter?
Professor Lockhart," Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
Professor Lockhart," Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher… me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I don’t talk about that. I didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh… hee, hee… Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might… provoke them!"
Professor Lockhart, Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
Professor Lockhart," Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Let’s see what you make of them, ha! Come on now- round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies! PIXIE Just stay there!"
Professor Lockhart, Peskipiksi pesternomi!
Professor Lockhart, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
Professor Lockhart," Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
Professor Lockhart," Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
Professor Lockhart, Sorry?
Professor Lockhart, Voice?
Professor Lockhart," What are you talking about, Harry? I think we’re getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We’ve been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one’s having fun. Heh, heh."
Professor Lockhart," Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn’t there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
Professor Lockhart," I’m afraid that’s my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
Professor Lockhart," Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
Professor Lockhart," Oh, poor boy doesn’t know what he’s saying. Now, this… won’t hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
Professor Lockhart," Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,…"
Professor Lockhart," …you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
Professor Lockhart," Much more flexible, though."
Professor Lockhart," Gather ‘round, gather ‘round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry- you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
Professor Lockhart, Whoaah!
Professor Lockhart," An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don’t mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
Professor Lockhart," An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… Let’s have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
Professor Lockhart," Good luck, Potter."
Professor Lockhart, Wands at the ready.
Professor Lockhart," On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don’t want any accidents here. One, two--"
Professor Lockhart," Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
Professor Lockhart, So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
Professor Lockhart, My m-moment?
Professor Lockhart," Very well- ah- I’ll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
Professor Lockhart," Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
Professor Lockhart," Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
Professor Lockhart, Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…
Professor Lockhart, Books can be misleading!
Professor Lockhart," My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things! HARRY You’re a fraud! You’ve just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!"
Professor Lockhart," Yes, now you mention it. I’m rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I’d never have sold another book. In fact, ah…I’m ah…going to have to do the same to you."
Professor Lockhart," Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I’ll just be, ah… There’s no need for me to stay."
Professor Lockhart," Now, boys what good will it do?"
Professor Lockhart," Um…but…obviously, yes. Sure you don’t want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It’s really quite filthy down here."
Professor Lockhart, It looks like a… snake.
Professor Lockhart," The adventure ends here, boys. But don’t fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
Professor Lockhart, Uhh… Hello. Who are you?
Professor Lockhart," Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
Professor Lockhart," It’s an odd sort of place this, isn’t it? Do you live here?"
Professor Lockhart, Really? Well?
Professor Lockhart, Amazing! This is just like magic!
Professor Mcgonagall," What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
Professor Mcgonagall," Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it’s your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”"
Professor Mcgonagall," That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
Professor Mcgonagall," Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
Professor Mcgonagall," Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin’s view, were unworthy to study magic."
Professor Mcgonagall," Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
Professor Mcgonagall," Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
Professor Mcgonagall," I think- do ya know- I think he’s been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker… (Poof)"
Professor Mcgonagall," What can this mean, Albus?"
Professor Mcgonagall, What should I tell the staff.
Professor Mcgonagall, Oh!
Professor Mcgonagall," This is out of my hands, Potter."
Professor Mcgonagall, Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
Professor Mcgonagall, This match has been cancelled.
Professor Mcgonagall," Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There’s something the both of you have to see."
Professor Mcgonagall," I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
Professor Mcgonagall," She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o’clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
Professor Mcgonagall," All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
Professor Mcgonagall," As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I’m afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
Professor Mcgonagall," Well, that’s settled. We’ll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
Professor Mcgonagall, Ginny Weasley.
Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention, please?"
Professor Sprout," Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
Professor Sprout," Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
Professor Sprout," Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won’t kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot… All Aah! Ooh!"
Professor Sprout, Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Professor Sprout," Uh, Longbottom’s been neglecting his earmuffs."
Professor Sprout," Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"
Ron," Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!…"
Ron, You’d better stand back. Let’s go!
Ron, Come on.
Ron," Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
Ron, I’ve got you Harry!
Ron, Drive!
Ron, Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?
Ron," It’s not much, but it’s home."
Ron," They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
Ron, Ginny. She’s been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really.
Ron," Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they’re fascinating."
Ron, He’s always doing that.
Ron," But Harry’s never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
Ron, Diagon Alley!
Ron, Mum fancies him.
Ron, Whao!
Ron, I don’t know. The gateway’s sealed its self for some reason.
Ron," Harry, if we can’t get through, maybe Mum and Dad can’t get back!"
Ron, The car…
Ron," Uh, right. Okay."
Ron, Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
Ron, Okay.
Ron, We can’t be far behind.
Ron, We must be gettin’ close.
Ron, Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
Ron, Yeah.
Ron, Welcome home.
Ron, It’s not working! Ahhhh!
Ron, Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh… Aahh!
Ron, Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
Ron, What’s happening?
Ron, Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
Ron," Scabbers, you OK? The car! …Dad’s gonna kill me."
Ron," Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
Ron," We’ll go and get our stuff, then."
Ron," You’re going to expel us, aren’t you?"
Ron," Huhh… Say it, I’m doomed."
Ron," Bloody bird’s a menace. Oh, no!"
Ron, What do we do now?
Ron, Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Ron, Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
Ron," You’ll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!"
Ron, (Blech…)
Ron, (Blech…)
Ron, (Blech…)
Ron, (Blech…) It’s disgusting.
Ron, Hear what?
Ron, Kill?
Ron, I don’t like spiders… What’s that?
Ron, Are you mad?
Ron, Ahem. Vera verto!
Ron, Three guesses who.
Ron, D’you think it’s true? D’you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Ron, Let’s think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Ron," Of course. You heard him! ‘You’ll be next Mudbloods,’"
Ron, Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Ron, Wicked! Malfoy’ll tell us anything.
Ron, I’ll stop it.
Ron," Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl’s lavatory? Don’t you think we’ll get caught?"
Ron, Why?
Ron, Who?
Ron, Who’s Moaning Myrtle?
Ron, Who cares?
Ron, You’re a Parselmouth? Why didn’t you tell us?
Ron," Oh, that’s what you said to it!"
Ron, I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
Ron," Exactly! Now the whole school’s gonna think you’re his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
Ron, How?
Ron, Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Ron, Ahem…
Ron, Yeah. Right.
Ron, How thick could you get?
Ron, Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
Ron, I think I’m gonna be sick!
Ron, That was close!
Ron, Look at your tail!
Ron, Have you spoken to Hermione?
Ron, Yuck!
Ron," But, it can’t hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it’ll just go right through you."
Ron," We don’t even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
Ron," That’ll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”"
Ron," Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Ron, Hermione!
Ron, But you heard McGonagall! We’re not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Ron," That’s Dad’s boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
Ron," Hagrid’s right! With Dumbledore gone, there’ll be an attack a day!"
Ron, What?!
Ron, They’re headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn’t it be “follow the butterflies?”
Ron," Harry, I don’t like this… Harry, I don’t like this at all!"
Ron, Can we go back now?
Ron, Harry.
Ron, Harry!
Ron, Ahh- hhh…
Ron, Can we panic now?
Ron, Know any spells?
Ron, Where’s Hermione when you need her?
Ron, Glad we’re out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
Ron, Thanks for that.
Ron, The flying gear’s jammed!
Ron, I’m trying!
Ron," Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I’ll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
Ron, What’s that?
Ron," But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one’s dead?"
Ron," And Mrs. Norris? I’m pretty sure she didn’t have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
Ron, But how’s a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
Ron, Pipes? It’s using the plumbing!
Ron, Moaning Myrtle.
Ron, ‘Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.’ Ginny…
Ron, What about my sister?!
Ron, You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can’t go now!
Ron, Is there anything you can do?
Ron," Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
Ron, Better you than us.
Ron, Ugh!
Ron, Go on.
Ron, What’s this?
Ron," Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
Ron, Harry! Harry!
Ron, I’m fine!
Ron, Um…Ron Weasley.
Ron, Lockhart’s memory charm backfired. He hasn’t got a clue who he is!
Ron, No!
Ron, What’ll do I do now?
Ron, OK.
Ron," Thanks, sir!"
Ron," Uhh-um… Welcome back, Hermione."
Ron, Uh… Harry?
Ron, Bloody hell!
Ron, Uh… Bloody hell.
Ron, But where’s Hermione?
Ron, Okay.
Ron," What are you doing d- uh, I mean… What are you doing down here?"
Ron, Uhh…
Ron, Ahem…Stomachache.
Ron, S- scar.
Seamus," No, ma’am, he’s just fainted."
Seamus," Look, everyone! Weasley’s got himself a Howler!"
Seamus, Cornish pixies?
Seamus," Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha…"
Sir Nicholas," Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
Sir Nicholas, Thank you!
Sir Nicholas, Good evening!
Sir Nicholas, Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!
Snape, You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that’s been on these grounds since before you were born.
Snape," Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is…"
Snape," Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
Snape," If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don’t recall seeing Potter at dinner."
Snape," Yes, Miss Granger?"
Snape, Expelliarmus!
Snape," Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
Snape," Weasley’s wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We’ll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
Snape," Don’t move, Potter. I’ll get rid of it for you."
Snape, Vipera evenesca.
Snape," A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
Snape, Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Tom Riddle,(rearranges) I AM LORD VOLDEMORT!
Tom Riddle, Professor Dumbledore.
Tom Riddle," Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
Tom Riddle," About the school, as well? I don’t have a home to go to. They wouldn’t really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
Tom Riddle, Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
Tom Riddle," No, sir. Nothing."
Tom Riddle," Good night, sir."
Tom Riddle," Evening, Hagrid. I’m going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don’t think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
Tom Riddle, The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Tom Riddle," Monsters don’t make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
Tom Riddle," Stand aside, Hagrid!"
Tom Riddle, Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
Tom Riddle," I can’t let you go. They’ll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You’ll be expelled."
Tom Riddle, She won’t wake.
Tom Riddle," She’s still alive, but only just."
Tom Riddle," A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
Tom Riddle, It won’t come until it’s called.
Tom Riddle, You won’t be needing it.
Tom Riddle," I’m afraid I can’t do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Tom Riddle," It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch’s cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
Tom Riddle," Because I told her to. You’ll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl’s bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
Tom Riddle," I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
Tom Riddle, It was my word against Hagrid’s. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Tom Riddle," He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work."
Tom Riddle," Haven’t I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?"
Tom Riddle," Voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air)"
Tom Riddle," Surely, you didn’t think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father’s name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
Tom Riddle, Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Tom Riddle," So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine."
Tom Riddle," Let’s match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won’t save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
Tom Riddle," No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
Tom Riddle," Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very… much… alive!"
Tom Riddle," Remarkable isn’t it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I’d guess you have little more than a minute to live. You’ll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter!
Uncle Vernon," I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go."
Uncle Vernon," Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
Uncle Vernon," I should think you’d be a little more grateful. We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
Uncle Vernon," Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…?"
Uncle Vernon," Good! And- and Dudley, you will be…?"
Uncle Vernon, Excellent! …And you…?
Uncle Vernon," Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
Uncle Vernon, Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Uncle Vernon," Ohh, don’t mind that! It’s just the cat."
Uncle Vernon, So when they arrive at the ninth hole…
Uncle Vernon, What the devil are you doing up here?
Uncle Vernon, You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
Uncle Vernon," One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
Uncle Vernon," …it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that’s just the top of it!”"
Uncle Vernon, I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That’s why I kept him upstairs!
Uncle Vernon, You’re never going back to that school. You’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Uncle Vernon," Now, what the hell’s he doing? Potter!"
Uncle Vernon," Petunia, he’s escaping!"
Uncle Vernon, Come here!
Uncle Vernon," Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!"
Uncle Vernon, No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Uncle Vernon, Oh… Damn.
