Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," Morning, Weasleys."
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley, What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley, Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron’s told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley, Did you really? How’d it go? Did you—
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," I mean…that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. Doesn’t miss a trick, that man."
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley, ‘Diaganilly.’
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," Children, it’s mad in here! Let’s go outside."
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley, Lucius.
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley,1058! Come on! Come on!
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," Fred, George, Percy you first!"
Gryffindor,Arthur Weasley," After you, dear."
No Entry,Aunt Petunia, He’s in there. Vernon…
No Entry,Aunt Petunia," Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
No Entry,Aunt Petunia," …in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
No Entry,Aunt Petunia, Oh!
Gryffindor,Colin," Hi, Harry! (flash) I’m Colin Creevy! I’m in Gryffindor, too!"
Gryffindor,Colin," (flash) Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
Hufflepuff,Cornelius Fudge," Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry’s got to act."
Hufflepuff,Cornelius Fudge," Albus look, Hagrid’s record is against him. I’ve got to take him."
Hufflepuff,Cornelius Fudge," I’m afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
Hufflepuff,Cornelius Fudge," Come, Hagrid… Well?"
Hufflepuff,Cornelius Fudge, Good boy.
Slytherin,Crabbe," Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Slytherin,Crabbe, It’s good right? Ah… Cool!
Slytherin,Crabbe & Goyle, Ummm…um.
Gryffindor,Dean Thomas, Ron? Is that your owl?
No Entry,Dobby," Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
No Entry,Dobby," Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
No Entry,Dobby," Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
No Entry,Dobby," S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho… Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo…"
No Entry,Dobby," Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
No Entry,Dobby," No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
No Entry,Dobby, Bad Dobby!
No Entry,Dobby, Baaad Dobby!
No Entry,Dobby, Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby!
No Entry,Dobby," Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
No Entry,Dobby," The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here…ooh… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
No Entry,Dobby, Ooo… er… can’t… say… argh...
No Entry,Dobby," Don’t make me talk, I— Errr…"
No Entry,Dobby, Bad Dobby.
No Entry,Dobby, Let me go!
No Entry,Dobby, Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?
No Entry,Dobby," Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
No Entry,Dobby, No! Ahh! Ooh…
No Entry,Dobby, (Snap!)
No Entry,Dobby, Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school!
No Entry,Dobby," Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good. (Snap!)"
No Entry,Dobby, (Snap!)
No Entry,Dobby, Hello!
No Entry,Dobby, Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
No Entry,Dobby," Indeed. Yes, sir."
No Entry,Dobby, At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
No Entry,Dobby," Uhuh… Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
No Entry,Dobby, Uh-huh-huh… Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
No Entry,Dobby," Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin…uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh…"
No Entry,Dobby," This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves’ enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
No Entry,Dobby, Ah! I shouldn’t have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
No Entry,Dobby," Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. HARRY No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
No Entry,Dobby, (Snap!)
No Entry,Dobby, Um-humm…
No Entry,Dobby, Ahh! Oow!
No Entry,Dobby, Master has given Dobby a sock!
No Entry,Dobby, You shall not harm Harry Potter!
No Entry,Dobby, Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
No Entry,Dobby," Anything, sir!"
Slytherin,Draco," I’ll bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
Slytherin,Draco," Oh look, Potter. You’ve got yourself a girlfriend."
Slytherin,Draco, That’s right. And that’s not all that new this year.
Slytherin,Draco," You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
Slytherin,Draco," No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
Slytherin,Draco," Ha, ha!"
Slytherin,Draco," Ha, ha…"
Slytherin,Draco," ‘Enemies of the heir beware!’ You’ll be next, Mudbloods!"
Slytherin,Draco," All right there, Scarhead?"
Slytherin,Draco," Training for the ballet, Potter?"
Slytherin,Draco," You’ll never catch me, Potter!"
Slytherin,Draco," Uhh, uhhh…"
Slytherin,Draco," Scared, Potter?"
Slytherin,Draco, Everte statium!
Slytherin,Draco, Serpensortia!
Slytherin,Draco," Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
Slytherin,Draco, Reading?
Slytherin,Draco," I didn’t know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
Slytherin,Draco," Well, sit down. You’d never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They’re an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What’s wrong with you, Crabbe?"
Slytherin,Draco," You know, I’m surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn’t done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
Slytherin,Draco, What? You think there’s someone here who’s worse than Dumbledore?
Slytherin,Draco," Good one, Goyle. You’re absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he’s the Heir of Slytherin!"
Slytherin,Draco," You know I don’t Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this It’s been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn’t tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it’s only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it’s Granger. What’s the matter with you two? You’re acting very…odd."
Slytherin,Draco, Hey! Where are you going?
No Entry,Dudley, Who’d want to be friends with you?
No Entry,Dudley, I’ll be waiting to open the door!
No Entry,Dudley, Dad! What’s going on?
No Entry,Dudley," Dad, hurry up!"
No Entry,Dudley, Dad!
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, …They are not.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Argus! Argus, I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," She’s not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say…"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, There’s been another attack.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, It means…that our students are in great danger.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Harry?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Oh, and about time, too. He’s been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Hagrid. HAGRID In fact, I’d be prepared ter swear it in front o’ the Ministry of Magic!"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Yes.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Very well, then. Off you go."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Riddle! Come.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I’m afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I understand Tom, but I’m afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Is there something you wish to tell me?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Very well, then. Off you go."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I’m not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Not intentionally, but yes."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," It’s true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley’s daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, I beg your pardon?
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Oh, yes."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Voldemort.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
No Entry,Filch," Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
No Entry,Filch," What’s going on ‘ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you…Mrs. Norris? You’ve…murdered my cat."
No Entry,Filch, I’ll kill ya… I’ll kill ya!
No Entry,Filch, Ask him. It’s him who’s done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
No Entry,Filch, Rubbish!
No Entry,Filch, My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
No Entry,Filch," Caught in the act! I’ll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
Gryffindor,Fred, Come on.
Gryffindor,Fred, Right.
Gryffindor,Fred," Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
Gryffindor,Fred," This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
Gryffindor,Fred," And not to mention, they’re dead scared that Harry’ll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
Gryffindor,George," Go, go, go, go!"
Gryffindor,George, Right!
Gryffindor,George," Yeah, Mum would never know."
Gryffindor,Ginny," Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
Gryffindor,Ginny, Leave him alone.
Gryffindor,Ginny," Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn’t mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you’re hurt!"
Gryffindor,Haary, ‘Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?’
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Harry?
Gryffindor,Hagrid, What do you think you’re doing down ‘ere? Come on!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin’ ‘round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don’ want no one ter see you there. People’ll think you were up to no good."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Me? Oh, I was… um… I was lookin’ for Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent. They’re ruinin’ all the school cabbages."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Hello, Hermione!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," You’ll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I’ll leave you to it, then."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Wo, this calls for a specialist’s equipment. Nothin’ to do but wait’ll it stops, I’m afraid."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Better out than in. Who’s Ron tryin’ to curse, anyway?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, He did not!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," See, the thing is, Harry, there’re some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they’re better’n everyone else because they’re what people call “pure blood.”"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," And it’s codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn’t a wizard alive today that’s not half blood or less. More ter the point, they’ve yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can’ do. Come here… Don’t you think on it, Hermione. Don’t you think on it for one minute… eh?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Blimey! Harry’s got himself a rogue Bludger! That’s been tampered with, that has!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Broken? There’s no bones left!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn’t Harry!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well, of course you don’t, and… Oh… Oh, right. Well, I’ll, umhum. I’ll just wait outside, then."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Let’s get yeh out of there.
Gryffindor,Hagrid, You can’t! You don’t understand.
Gryffindor,Hagrid, It wasn’t him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, No!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, No!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Aragog! Aragog!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Mad and hairy? You wouldn’t be talking about me now, would ya?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, It’s a- Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin’ to Professor Sprout, they’ve still got a bit o’ growing up to do. But, once their acne’s cleared up, we’ll be able to chop ‘em up and stew ‘em, and then we’ll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin’ after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Hello, Neville!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Who’s there? Hello? Hello?
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn’t matter- come on inI just made a pot o’ tea."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, I’m fine! I’m alright.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ’."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," What you had to understand about that is— (knock, knock, knock) Quick under the cloak. Don’t say a word. Be quiet, both o’ you… Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Of course! Come in! Come in.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
Gryffindor,Hagrid, What’re you doin’ here? Get outta my house!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Yeh can’ take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chance! You mark my words, there’ll be killin’s next!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they’d have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That’s all I have to say. Oh, and someone’ll need to feed Fang while I’m away."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Sorry I’m late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I’d just like to say that aif it hadn’t been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o’ course, I woulduh- I’d still be you-know-where, so I- I’d just like to say ‘Thanks.’"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Oh!
Gryffindor,Harry, Now you’ve done it.
Gryffindor,Harry, But she’s bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
Gryffindor,Harry, But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer.
Gryffindor,Harry," I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist."
Gryffindor,Harry, Who are you?
Gryffindor,Harry," Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
Gryffindor,Harry, Why don’t you sit down?
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything."
Gryffindor,Harry, You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
Gryffindor,Harry," Stop, Dobby!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby, shh!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby, please stop!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Your family?
Gryffindor,Harry, What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
Gryffindor,Harry, Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
Gryffindor,Harry, Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Gryffindor,Harry," Get in there, and keep quiet!"
Gryffindor,Harry, I- I was just—
Gryffindor,Harry, Sorry.
Gryffindor,Harry," Yes, sir… See why I’ve got to go back? I don’t belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It’s the only place I’ve got friends!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, I expect they’ve… been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Give me those, now!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby, get back here!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby, please, no!"
Gryffindor,Harry, I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
Gryffindor,Harry, Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Gryffindor,Harry, Ahh- ahh!
Gryffindor,Harry, Let go of me!
Gryffindor,Harry, Get off!
Gryffindor,Harry, I think it’s brilliant
Gryffindor,Harry, Hello. W-what did I do?
Gryffindor,Harry, Raids?
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, umm…"
Gryffindor,Harry, Floo powder?
Gryffindor,Harry, ‘Diaganilly.’
Gryffindor,Harry," I’m fine, thank you. I- I was just…"
Gryffindor,Harry, No! Please!
Gryffindor,Harry, Hagrid!
Gryffindor,Harry," I was lost, I— hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, it’s great to see you, too!"
Gryffindor,Harry, I definitely need to remember that one.
Gryffindor,Harry, Thank you. Bye.
Gryffindor,Harry, Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Gryffindor,Harry, Let’s go.
Gryffindor,Harry, Aah!
Gryffindor,Harry, Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can’t we get through?
Gryffindor,Harry, The train leaves at exactly eleven o’clock. We’ve missed it!
Gryffindor,Harry, Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Gryffindor,Harry," Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren’t accustomed to seeing a flying car."
Gryffindor,Harry," Well come on, then. Let’s go lower. We need to find the train."
Gryffindor,Harry, Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Gryffindor,Harry, Do you hear that?
Gryffindor,Harry, Hold on…
Gryffindor,Harry, Wha-aahhh!
Gryffindor,Harry, I’m trying. Your hand’s all sweaty.
Gryffindor,Harry, I think we found the train.
Gryffindor,Harry, Up! Up!
Gryffindor,Harry, Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
Gryffindor,Harry, Ahh!
Gryffindor,Harry, Be thankful it’s not your neck.
Gryffindor,Harry, I don’t know.
Gryffindor,Harry, Come on! Go! Fast!
Gryffindor,Harry," See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can’t get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn’t want me here this year."
Gryffindor,Harry, Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
Gryffindor,Harry, You’re doomed.
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
Gryffindor,Harry, Stop! Stop! Hold still!
Gryffindor,Harry, Malfoy?
Gryffindor,Harry," No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let’s take him to Hagrid’s."
Gryffindor,Harry, He’ll know what to do.
Gryffindor,Harry, Ah! Oh… Okay.
Gryffindor,Harry," Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don’t- I don’t know exactly what it means."
Gryffindor,Harry, What’s a Mudblood?
Gryffindor,Harry, That’s horrible!
Gryffindor,Harry, Not really.
Gryffindor,Harry, What?
Gryffindor,Harry, That voice.
Gryffindor,Harry, Didn’t you hear it?
Gryffindor,Harry, Spooky.
Gryffindor,Harry, Did you hear it?
Gryffindor,Harry, That voice.
Gryffindor,Harry, I heard it first in Lockhart’s office. And then again just—
Gryffindor,Harry, It’s moving. I think it’s going to kill.
Gryffindor,Harry, Strange. I’ve never seen spiders act like that.
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, no… It’s Filch’s cat. It’s Mrs. Norris."
Gryffindor,Harry, No. No.
Gryffindor,Harry," It’s not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
Gryffindor,Harry, When I said I wasn’t hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Gryffindor,Harry, Strange?
Gryffindor,Harry," Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, maybe Ron’s right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, how long will it take to make?"
Gryffindor,Harry," A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Gryffindor,Harry, Wood! Look out!
Gryffindor,Harry, Thank you.
Gryffindor,Harry," No, I think my- I think my arm’s broken."
Gryffindor,Harry," No, not you."
Gryffindor,Harry, Ugh!
Gryffindor,Harry, Uh!
Gryffindor,Harry, Dobby?
Gryffindor,Harry, It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Gryffindor,Harry, You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Gryffindor,Harry, Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Gryffindor,Harry," You’d better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
Gryffindor,Harry, I don’t suppose you could tell me why you’re trying to kill me?
Gryffindor,Harry, Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Gryffindor,Harry, Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Gryffindor,Harry," Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who’s doing it now?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Thank you, sir."
Gryffindor,Harry, You wish.
Gryffindor,Harry, Rictusempra!
Gryffindor,Harry, Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
Gryffindor,Harry, I’m a what?
Gryffindor,Harry," I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
Gryffindor,Harry, What’s bad? If I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin.
Gryffindor,Harry, You were there! You heard me!
Gryffindor,Harry, I spoke a different language? But- I didn’t realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Gryffindor,Harry, But I’m not… I can’t be.
Gryffindor,Harry, I’ll see you back in the common room.
Gryffindor,Harry, No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don’t understand!
Gryffindor,Harry, Professor… I swear I didn’t!
Gryffindor,Harry, Professor Dumbledore?
Gryffindor,Harry, I… I-I was- I was just wondering if you’d put me in the right house.
Gryffindor,Harry, You’re wrong.
Gryffindor,Harry," Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
Gryffindor,Harry," You don’t think it was me, Professor?"
Gryffindor,Harry," No, sir. Nothing."
Gryffindor,Harry," Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Gryffindor,Harry, Come on. Let’s get ‘em.
Gryffindor,Harry, Ughh!
Gryffindor,Harry," Hermione, come out. We’ve got loads to tell you!"
Gryffindor,Harry, Hermione? A- are you OK?
Gryffindor,Harry," She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls… What’s this?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Looks like Moaning Myrtle’s flooded the bathroom.
Gryffindor,Harry, Why would I throw something at you?
Gryffindor,Harry," But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
Gryffindor,Harry, ‘Tom Marvolo Riddle.’
Gryffindor,Harry, ‘My name is Harry Potter.’
Gryffindor,Harry, ‘Can you tell me?’
Gryffindor,Harry, Excuse me. Could you tell me what’s going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Gryffindor,Harry, Dumbledore?
Gryffindor,Harry, Hagrid! Haagriid!
Gryffindor,Harry, Woah!
Gryffindor,Harry, It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
Gryffindor,Harry," The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Gryffindor,Harry," W- what’s that you’ve got, Hagrid?"
Gryffindor,Harry, And they found it. Tom Riddle’s diary is gone.
Gryffindor,Harry, No.
Gryffindor,Harry," We’ve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can’t believe it’s him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start."
Gryffindor,Harry, I think it’s time to get my Dad’s old cloak out again.
Gryffindor,Harry, What’s that for?
Gryffindor,Harry," Hagrid, are you okay?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Did you hear about Hermione?
Gryffindor,Harry," Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
Gryffindor,Harry, You heard what Hagrid said; ‘Follow the spiders.’
Gryffindor,Harry, Shush!
Gryffindor,Harry, Come on!
Gryffindor,Harry, Don’t panic.
Gryffindor,Harry, We’re friends of Hagrid’s. And you? Y- y-you’re Aragog aren’t you?
Gryffindor,Harry," He’s in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it’s Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Gryffindor,Harry, Then you’re not the monster.
Gryffindor,Harry," Shush. But if you’re not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
Gryffindor,Harry, But have you seen it?
Gryffindor,Harry, What?
Gryffindor,Harry," One, but it’s not powerful enough for all of them."
Gryffindor,Harry, Let’s go! Arania exumai! Go!
Gryffindor,Harry, Arania exumai!
Gryffindor,Harry, Don’t mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Gryffindor,Harry, Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Gryffindor,Harry, Come on! Pull!
Gryffindor,Harry, We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Gryffindor,Harry," Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
Gryffindor,Harry," Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
Gryffindor,Harry," ‘Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent’s eye. Spiders flee before it.’ Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That’s why I can hear it speak. It’s a snake!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he’s a ghost- he couldn’t die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
Gryffindor,Harry, The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk’s reflection. ‘Spiders flee before it.’ It all fits!
Gryffindor,Harry," Hermione’s answered that, too."
Gryffindor,Harry," Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
Gryffindor,Harry," Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
Gryffindor,Harry, You’re running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
Gryffindor,Harry, You wrote them!
Gryffindor,Harry, Don’t even think about it.
Gryffindor,Harry, To ask you how you died.
Gryffindor,Harry, Who was it Myrtle?
Gryffindor,Harry," This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Gryffindor,Harry, Hesha- Hassah.
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, yes there is! You first."
Gryffindor,Harry, All right. Let’s go.
Gryffindor,Harry, Uh…thanks Myrtle.
Gryffindor,Harry," Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Gryffindor,Harry, It’s a snakeskin.
Gryffindor,Harry," Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
Gryffindor,Harry, You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I’ll go on and find Ginny!
Gryffindor,Harry, Hesha- Hassah.
Gryffindor,Harry," Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, ‘she won’t wake?’ She’s not…?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Are you a ghost?
Gryffindor,Harry," She’s cold as ice. Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up! You’ve got to help me, Tom. There’s a basilisk."
Gryffindor,Harry," Give me my wand, Tom."
Gryffindor,Harry," Listen, we’ve got to go! We’ve got to save her!"
Gryffindor,Harry, No. She couldn’t. She wouldn’t!
Gryffindor,Harry, But why?
Gryffindor,Harry," But, why did you want to meet me?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Hagrid’s my friend! And you framed him, didn’t you?"
Gryffindor,Harry, I’ll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, you haven’t finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Gryffindor,Harry, Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Gryffindor,Harry, You! You’re the Heir of Slytherin. You’re Voldemort.
Gryffindor,Harry, Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Gryffindor,Harry, He’ll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Gryffindor,Harry, Ginny-
Gryffindor,Harry, Ginny…
Gryffindor,Harry," Don’t worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you’ll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn’t quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It’s alright, Ginny. It’s over. It’s just a memory."
Gryffindor,Harry," It’s just… You see, sir I- I couldn’t help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Gryffindor,Harry, Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
Gryffindor,Harry, So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Gryffindor,Harry, Because I asked it to.
Gryffindor,Harry, Godric Gryffindor.
Gryffindor,Harry, Don’t worry. I will be.
Gryffindor,Harry," Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Gryffindor,Harry, Open it.
Gryffindor,Harry, Just promise me something.
Gryffindor,Harry, Never try to save my life again.
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn’t have done it without you."
Gryffindor,Harry," Well, there’s no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
Gryffindor,Harry, Ron!
Gryffindor,Harry, We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Gryffindor,Harry, Excellent.
Gryffindor,Harry," Hermione, are you okay?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Come on.
Gryffindor,Harry, I think the Slytherin common room’s this way.
Gryffindor,Harry, I’m…
Gryffindor,Harry, Ah- um… Reading.
Gryffindor,Harry, Uh-huh.
Gryffindor,Harry, You’re wrong!
Gryffindor,Harry, Harry Potter? (gulp)
Gryffindor,Harry, But then you must have some idea who’s behind it all.
Gryffindor,Harry, It’s his… stomachache. Calm down.
Gryffindor,Harry, Hair!
Gryffindor,Harry," I can’t let you out, Hedwig. I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
Gryffindor,Hermione, Harry! Hagrid!
Gryffindor,Hermione," Oh, it’s so good to see you!"
Gryffindor,Hermione, What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Ok! Bye!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Come on! Everyone’s been so worried.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It’s also quite dangerous. The Mandrake’s cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Get off me!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Immobulus!
Gryffindor,Hermione, At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
Gryffindor,Hermione," You okay, Ron? Say something!"
Gryffindor,Hermione, He called me a Mudblood.
Gryffindor,Hermione, It means “dirty blood.” Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It’s not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Harry!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Voice? What voice?
Gryffindor,Hermione," Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
Gryffindor,Hermione, ‘The Chamber of Secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.’ It’s written in blood.
Gryffindor,Hermione," That’s why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We’d just found him when he said…"
Gryffindor,Hermione," It’s a bit strange, isn’t it?"
Gryffindor,Hermione," You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It’s just… strange."
Gryffindor,Hermione," No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn’t a good sign."
Gryffindor,Hermione," Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about…the Chamber of Secrets?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, Muggle-borns.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Gryffindor,Hermione, Yes. Couldn’t you tell? McGonagall’s worried. All the teachers are.
Gryffindor,Hermione," The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, If you’re talking about Malfoy.
Gryffindor,Hermione," I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
Gryffindor,Hermione," Even they aren’t that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it’ll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
Gryffindor,Hermione," Here it is. ‘The Polyjuice Potion.’ (Reading from Moste Potente Potions) ‘Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.’ RON Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we’ll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, Yes.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Exactly. But it’s tricky. I’ve never seen a more complicated potion.
Gryffindor,Hermione, A month.
Gryffindor,Hermione, I know. But it’s the only plan we’ve got.
Gryffindor,Hermione, No! Even with a proper wand it’s too risky. You could hit Harry!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Let’s go.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Finite incantatem!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Are you okay?
Gryffindor,Hermione," You will be able to, won’t you?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? RON Of course. Don’t you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he’s taught Draco how to do it.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Maybe. We’ll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Heh… No. No one ever comes in here.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Moaning Myrtle.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Moaning Myrtle.
Gryffindor,Hermione, She’s a little sensitive.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Do you think he’s all right?
Gryffindor,Hermione, Oh!
Gryffindor,Hermione, You can talk to snakes.
Gryffindor,Hermione," No, they can’t. It’s not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
Gryffindor,Hermione," I don’t know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There’s a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
Gryffindor,Hermione," He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Everything’s set. We just need a bit of who you’re changing into. HARRY Crabbe and Goyle.
Gryffindor,Hermione, We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t burst in on us while we’re interrogating Malfoy.
Gryffindor,Hermione," I’ve got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they’re asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
Gryffindor,Hermione, I’ve already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode– Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I’m going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Gryffindor,Hermione, We’ll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves… Add the hairs.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Cheers!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Me too.
Gryffindor,Hermione, I- I don’t think I’m going. You go on without me!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Just go. You’re wasting time!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Go away!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat’s hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode’s robes. Look at my face.
Gryffindor,Hermione, It can’t be Hagrid. It just can’t be.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Look. Hagrid’s our friend. Why don’t we just go and ask him about it?
Gryffindor,Hermione, It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn’t a student.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
Gryffindor,Hermione, It’s good to be back! Congratulations! I can’t believe you solved it!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Thanks.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Oh, no!"
Hufflepuff,Justin Finch-Fletchley, What are you playing at?
Gryffindor,Lee Jordan, Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Gryffindor,Lee Jordan, Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name…or very foolish."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco’s told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren’t they? Let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they’re paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I’d say not. What’s the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I’ll see you at work. DRACO See you at school.
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Already here, Fudge? Good…"
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," The other governors and I have decided it’s time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You’ll find all twelve signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’ve rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, You think so?
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," I’ll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it’s true-- you have returned!"
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Ridiculous!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, How dare you?!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, And? Who was it?
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Ah!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, I see.
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We’re leaving."
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Mine? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," You do, do you? Why don’t you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Dobby?
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, What? I didn’t give. DOBBY Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, You’ve lost me my servant!
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy, Advada.
Slytherin,Lucius Malfoy," Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
Hufflepuff,Madame Pomfrey, Oh!
Hufflepuff,Madame Pomfrey," Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should’ve been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…"
Hufflepuff,Madame Pomfrey," Oh, I’ll be able to, certainly. But it’ll be painful. You’re in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
Hufflepuff,Madame Pomfrey," Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
Hufflepuff,Madame Pomfrey, Put him here. What happened?
Hufflepuff,Madame Pomfrey," Who is it that the monster’s taken, Minerva?"
Slytherin,Marcus Flint, Quidditch practice.
Slytherin,Marcus Flint," Easy, Wood. I’ve got a note."
Slytherin,Marcus Flint, A gift from Draco’s father.
Slytherin,Marcus Flint, Yeah! Yeah!
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," I’m Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn’t expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh…aaaah!"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Ahh! Wait till you see. It’s awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle, Aaah!
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Hee, ha, ha!"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Ha, ha, ha!"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huh– huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Don’t ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me."
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle, Sure! Let’s all throw books at Myrtle because she can’t feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," I don’t know, I didn’t see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo…"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Oh! Who’s there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," I don’t know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh…But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… I died. HARRY Just like that? How?"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo…"
Ravenclaw,Moaning Myrtle," Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you’re welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That’s it. There we go."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, Morning Arthur!
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, Arthur!
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Oh, no."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, We’ll manage. There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it’s done. Yes. In you go… That’s it."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," You see? It’s quite easy, dear. Don’t be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That’s it, mind your head. That’s right. Now take your Floo powder. That’s it, very good. Now, don’t forget to speak very, very clearly."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," What did he say, dear?"
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, I thought he did.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We’d hoped you’d only gone one grate too far…"
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, Ah! Here he is!
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Harry, now you give me those, and I’ll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That’s it, Ron."
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, The train will be leaving any moment!
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley, Okay.
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," Come on, Ginny, we’ll get you a seat. Hurry!"
Gryffindor,Mrs. Weasley," RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER’S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Thhhhbt!"
Gryffindor,Neville, Uhh…
Gryffindor,Neville," Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
Gryffindor,Neville, Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah!
Gryffindor,Neville," Hey, get me down!"
Gryffindor,Neville, Why is it always me?
Gryffindor,Neville," Harry- I don’t know who did it, but you’d better come! Come on!"
Gryffindor,Neville, Harry- it’s Hermione!
Gryffindor,Percy, Errol…
Gryffindor,Percy," Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well."
Gryffindor,Percy," Hello, Sir Nicholas!"
Gryffindor,Percy, Excuse me.
Gryffindor,Percy," I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
Gryffindor,Percy," Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, It can’t be- Harry Potter?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher… me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I don’t talk about that. I didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh… hee, hee… Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might… provoke them!"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Let’s see what you make of them, ha! Come on now- round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies! PIXIE Just stay there!"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Peskipiksi pesternomi!
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Sorry?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Voice?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," What are you talking about, Harry? I think we’re getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We’ve been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one’s having fun. Heh, heh."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn’t there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," I’m afraid that’s my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Oh, poor boy doesn’t know what he’s saying. Now, this… won’t hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,…"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," …you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Much more flexible, though."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Gather ‘round, gather ‘round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry- you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Whoaah!
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don’t mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… Let’s have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Good luck, Potter."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Wands at the ready.
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don’t want any accidents here. One, two--"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, My m-moment?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Very well- ah- I’ll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Books can be misleading!
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things! HARRY You’re a fraud! You’ve just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Yes, now you mention it. I’m rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I’d never have sold another book. In fact, ah…I’m ah…going to have to do the same to you."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I’ll just be, ah… There’s no need for me to stay."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Now, boys what good will it do?"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Um…but…obviously, yes. Sure you don’t want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It’s really quite filthy down here."
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, It looks like a… snake.
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," The adventure ends here, boys. But don’t fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Uhh… Hello. Who are you?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart," It’s an odd sort of place this, isn’t it? Do you live here?"
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Really? Well?
Ravenclaw,Professor Lockhart, Amazing! This is just like magic!
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it’s your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”"
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin’s view, were unworthy to study magic."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," I think- do ya know- I think he’s been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker… (Poof)"
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," What can this mean, Albus?"
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall, What should I tell the staff.
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall, Oh!
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," This is out of my hands, Potter."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall, Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall, This match has been cancelled.
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There’s something the both of you have to see."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o’clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I’m afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Well, that’s settled. We’ll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall, Ginny Weasley.
Gryffindor,Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention, please?"
Hufflepuff,Professor Sprout," Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
Hufflepuff,Professor Sprout," Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
Hufflepuff,Professor Sprout," Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won’t kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot… All Aah! Ooh!"
Hufflepuff,Professor Sprout, Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Hufflepuff,Professor Sprout," Uh, Longbottom’s been neglecting his earmuffs."
Hufflepuff,Professor Sprout," Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!…"
Gryffindor,Ron, You’d better stand back. Let’s go!
Gryffindor,Ron, Come on.
Gryffindor,Ron," Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
Gryffindor,Ron, I’ve got you Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron, Drive!
Gryffindor,Ron, Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?
Gryffindor,Ron," It’s not much, but it’s home."
Gryffindor,Ron," They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Ginny. She’s been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really.
Gryffindor,Ron," Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they’re fascinating."
Gryffindor,Ron, He’s always doing that.
Gryffindor,Ron," But Harry’s never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
Gryffindor,Ron, Diagon Alley!
Gryffindor,Ron, Mum fancies him.
Gryffindor,Ron, Whao!
Gryffindor,Ron, I don’t know. The gateway’s sealed its self for some reason.
Gryffindor,Ron," Harry, if we can’t get through, maybe Mum and Dad can’t get back!"
Gryffindor,Ron, The car…
Gryffindor,Ron," Uh, right. Okay."
Gryffindor,Ron, Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
Gryffindor,Ron, Okay.
Gryffindor,Ron, We can’t be far behind.
Gryffindor,Ron, We must be gettin’ close.
Gryffindor,Ron, Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
Gryffindor,Ron, Yeah.
Gryffindor,Ron, Welcome home.
Gryffindor,Ron, It’s not working! Ahhhh!
Gryffindor,Ron, Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh… Aahh!
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
Gryffindor,Ron, What’s happening?
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
Gryffindor,Ron," Scabbers, you OK? The car! …Dad’s gonna kill me."
Gryffindor,Ron," Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
Gryffindor,Ron," We’ll go and get our stuff, then."
Gryffindor,Ron," You’re going to expel us, aren’t you?"
Gryffindor,Ron," Huhh… Say it, I’m doomed."
Gryffindor,Ron," Bloody bird’s a menace. Oh, no!"
Gryffindor,Ron, What do we do now?
Gryffindor,Ron, Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Gryffindor,Ron, Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
Gryffindor,Ron," You’ll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!"
Gryffindor,Ron, (Blech…)
Gryffindor,Ron, (Blech…)
Gryffindor,Ron, (Blech…)
Gryffindor,Ron, (Blech…) It’s disgusting.
Gryffindor,Ron, Hear what?
Gryffindor,Ron, Kill?
Gryffindor,Ron, I don’t like spiders… What’s that?
Gryffindor,Ron, Are you mad?
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahem. Vera verto!
Gryffindor,Ron, Three guesses who.
Gryffindor,Ron, D’you think it’s true? D’you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Gryffindor,Ron, Let’s think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Gryffindor,Ron," Of course. You heard him! ‘You’ll be next Mudbloods,’"
Gryffindor,Ron, Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Gryffindor,Ron, Wicked! Malfoy’ll tell us anything.
Gryffindor,Ron, I’ll stop it.
Gryffindor,Ron," Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl’s lavatory? Don’t you think we’ll get caught?"
Gryffindor,Ron, Why?
Gryffindor,Ron, Who?
Gryffindor,Ron, Who’s Moaning Myrtle?
Gryffindor,Ron, Who cares?
Gryffindor,Ron, You’re a Parselmouth? Why didn’t you tell us?
Gryffindor,Ron," Oh, that’s what you said to it!"
Gryffindor,Ron, I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
Gryffindor,Ron," Exactly! Now the whole school’s gonna think you’re his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
Gryffindor,Ron, How?
Gryffindor,Ron, Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahem…
Gryffindor,Ron, Yeah. Right.
Gryffindor,Ron, How thick could you get?
Gryffindor,Ron, Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
Gryffindor,Ron, I think I’m gonna be sick!
Gryffindor,Ron, That was close!
Gryffindor,Ron, Look at your tail!
Gryffindor,Ron, Have you spoken to Hermione?
Gryffindor,Ron, Yuck!
Gryffindor,Ron," But, it can’t hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it’ll just go right through you."
Gryffindor,Ron," We don’t even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
Gryffindor,Ron," That’ll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”"
Gryffindor,Ron," Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Gryffindor,Ron, Hermione!
Gryffindor,Ron, But you heard McGonagall! We’re not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Gryffindor,Ron," That’s Dad’s boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Hagrid’s right! With Dumbledore gone, there’ll be an attack a day!"
Gryffindor,Ron, What?!
Gryffindor,Ron, They’re headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn’t it be “follow the butterflies?”
Gryffindor,Ron," Harry, I don’t like this… Harry, I don’t like this at all!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Can we go back now?
Gryffindor,Ron, Harry.
Gryffindor,Ron, Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh- hhh…
Gryffindor,Ron, Can we panic now?
Gryffindor,Ron, Know any spells?
Gryffindor,Ron, Where’s Hermione when you need her?
Gryffindor,Ron, Glad we’re out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
Gryffindor,Ron, Thanks for that.
Gryffindor,Ron, The flying gear’s jammed!
Gryffindor,Ron, I’m trying!
Gryffindor,Ron," Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I’ll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
Gryffindor,Ron, What’s that?
Gryffindor,Ron," But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one’s dead?"
Gryffindor,Ron," And Mrs. Norris? I’m pretty sure she didn’t have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
Gryffindor,Ron, But how’s a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
Gryffindor,Ron, Pipes? It’s using the plumbing!
Gryffindor,Ron, Moaning Myrtle.
Gryffindor,Ron, ‘Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.’ Ginny…
Gryffindor,Ron, What about my sister?!
Gryffindor,Ron, You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can’t go now!
Gryffindor,Ron, Is there anything you can do?
Gryffindor,Ron," Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Better you than us.
Gryffindor,Ron, Ugh!
Gryffindor,Ron, Go on.
Gryffindor,Ron, What’s this?
Gryffindor,Ron," Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
Gryffindor,Ron, Harry! Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron, I’m fine!
Gryffindor,Ron, Um…Ron Weasley.
Gryffindor,Ron, Lockhart’s memory charm backfired. He hasn’t got a clue who he is!
Gryffindor,Ron, No!
Gryffindor,Ron, What’ll do I do now?
Gryffindor,Ron, OK.
Gryffindor,Ron," Thanks, sir!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Uhh-um… Welcome back, Hermione."
Gryffindor,Ron, Uh… Harry?
Gryffindor,Ron, Bloody hell!
Gryffindor,Ron, Uh… Bloody hell.
Gryffindor,Ron, But where’s Hermione?
Gryffindor,Ron, Okay.
Gryffindor,Ron," What are you doing d- uh, I mean… What are you doing down here?"
Gryffindor,Ron, Uhh…
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahem…Stomachache.
Gryffindor,Ron, S- scar.
Gryffindor,Seamus," No, ma’am, he’s just fainted."
Gryffindor,Seamus," Look, everyone! Weasley’s got himself a Howler!"
Gryffindor,Seamus, Cornish pixies?
Gryffindor,Seamus," Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha…"
Gryffindor,Sir Nicholas," Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
Gryffindor,Sir Nicholas, Thank you!
Gryffindor,Sir Nicholas, Good evening!
Gryffindor,Sir Nicholas, Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!
Slytherin,Snape, You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that’s been on these grounds since before you were born.
Slytherin,Snape," Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is…"
Slytherin,Snape," Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
Slytherin,Snape," If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don’t recall seeing Potter at dinner."
Slytherin,Snape," Yes, Miss Granger?"
Slytherin,Snape, Expelliarmus!
Slytherin,Snape," Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
Slytherin,Snape," Weasley’s wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We’ll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
Slytherin,Snape," Don’t move, Potter. I’ll get rid of it for you."
Slytherin,Snape, Vipera evenesca.
Slytherin,Snape," A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
Slytherin,Snape, Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Slytherin,Tom Riddle,(rearranges) I AM LORD VOLDEMORT!
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, Professor Dumbledore.
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," About the school, as well? I don’t have a home to go to. They wouldn’t really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," No, sir. Nothing."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Good night, sir."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Evening, Hagrid. I’m going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don’t think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Monsters don’t make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Stand aside, Hagrid!"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," I can’t let you go. They’ll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You’ll be expelled."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, She won’t wake.
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," She’s still alive, but only just."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, It won’t come until it’s called.
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, You won’t be needing it.
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," I’m afraid I can’t do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch’s cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Because I told her to. You’ll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl’s bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, It was my word against Hagrid’s. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Haven’t I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air)"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Surely, you didn’t think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father’s name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle, Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine."
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Let’s match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won’t save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very… much… alive!"
Slytherin,Tom Riddle," Remarkable isn’t it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I’d guess you have little more than a minute to live. You’ll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go."
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," I should think you’d be a little more grateful. We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…?"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Good! And- and Dudley, you will be…?"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, Excellent! …And you…?
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Ohh, don’t mind that! It’s just the cat."
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, So when they arrive at the ninth hole…
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, What the devil are you doing up here?
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," …it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that’s just the top of it!”"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That’s why I kept him upstairs!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, You’re never going back to that school. You’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Now, what the hell’s he doing? Potter!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Petunia, he’s escaping!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, Come here!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon," Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!"
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
No Entry,Uncle Vernon, Oh… Damn.
Gryffindor,Albus," Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
Slytherin,Draco," It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}"
Slytherin,Draco, Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}
Slytherin,Draco," {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}"
Slytherin,Draco," No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
Slytherin,Draco," Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}"
Slytherin,Draco, Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Slytherin,Draco, No!
Slytherin,Draco," Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
Slytherin,Draco, The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!
Slytherin,Draco, Okay. Then I get Fang!
Slytherin,Draco, You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Slytherin,Draco," Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
Slytherin,Draco," {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!"
Slytherin,Draco," Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}"
No Entry,Dudley," Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
No Entry,Dudley, How many are there?
No Entry,Dudley, Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!
No Entry,Dudley, I don't care how big they are!
No Entry,Dudley, Make it move.
No Entry,Dudley, MOVE!
No Entry,Dudley, He's boring.
No Entry,Dudley," Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!"
No Entry,Dudley, Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
No Entry,Dudley," Mum, mummy!"
No Entry,Dudley," Mum, help! Help me!"
No Entry,Dudley," {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!"
No Entry,Dudley, AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}
No Entry,Dudley, What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
No Entry,Dudley," Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!"
No Entry,Dudley, I-I-I'm not Harry.
No Entry,Dudley, {whimpers}
No Entry,Dudley, Ahh!
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Hagrid is bringing him.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, The only family he has.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Good luck...Harry Potter.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Let the feast...begin.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore, Fine. They're both just fine.
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}"
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom."
Gryffindor,Dumbledore," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
No Entry,Filch," Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}"
No Entry,Filch," Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
No Entry,Filch," A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
No Entry,Filch," Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
No Entry,Filch," There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}"
No Entry,Firenze," Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
No Entry,Firenze," A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
No Entry,Firenze, Can you think of no one?
No Entry,Firenze, Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
No Entry,Firenze," Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
Slytherin,Flint, Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}
Slytherin,Flint, {to other members} Take that side!
Ravenclaw,Flitwick," One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then."
Ravenclaw,Flitwick," Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
Ravenclaw,Flitwick, Whooaaa! Ooh.
Gryffindor,Fred," Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!"
Gryffindor,Fred," I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}"
Gryffindor,Fred," Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
Gryffindor,Fred," Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard."
Gryffindor,George," He's not Fred, I am!"
Gryffindor,George," Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
Gryffindor,George, But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
No Entry,Griphook," Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}"
No Entry,Griphook, Vault 713.
No Entry,Griphook, Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," You're a wizard, Harry."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
Gryffindor,Hagrid, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen Albus Dumbledore."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, If you know where to go.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," See, Harry, you're famous!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}
Gryffindor,Hagrid," You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Shh!!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Hello, Harry."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Well done!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Go go go!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Looks like he's gonna be sick!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Yes!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}
Gryffindor,Hagrid," {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Oh.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
Gryffindor,Hagrid," You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...
Gryffindor,Hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh, dear."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Right. Let's go.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}"
Gryffindor,Hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
Gryffindor,Hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!
Gryffindor,Hagrid, Yes! {grins}
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
Gryffindor,Hagrid," I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go."
Gryffindor,Harry," Yes, Aunt Petunia."
Gryffindor,Harry," Yes, Uncle Vernon."
Gryffindor,Harry, He's asleep!
Gryffindor,Harry," Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you."
Gryffindor,Harry," Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
Gryffindor,Harry, Anytime.
Gryffindor,Harry, {Grins and giggles}
Gryffindor,Harry, Ow!
Gryffindor,Harry, I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
Gryffindor,Harry," Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
Gryffindor,Harry," {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---"
Gryffindor,Harry, Get off! Ahh!
Gryffindor,Harry, They're my letters! Let go of me!
Gryffindor,Harry," Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}"
Gryffindor,Harry," Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads Happee Birdae Harry.}"
Gryffindor,Harry," {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Sorry, no."
Gryffindor,Harry, Learnt what?
Gryffindor,Harry, I-I'm a what?
Gryffindor,Harry," A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
Gryffindor,Harry," No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
Gryffindor,Harry," Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"
Gryffindor,Harry, You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?
Gryffindor,Harry, Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Gryffindor,Harry, Muggle?
Gryffindor,Harry, {laughs}
Gryffindor,Harry, {Nods} Okay.
Gryffindor,Harry," All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}"
Gryffindor,Harry, Good-bye.
Gryffindor,Harry," But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
Gryffindor,Harry," But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
Gryffindor,Harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?"
Gryffindor,Harry," What's in there, Hagrid?"
Gryffindor,Harry, I still need...a wand.
Gryffindor,Harry, {Softly} Hello? Hello?
Gryffindor,Harry, Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}
Gryffindor,Harry," Sorry, but what's curious?"
Gryffindor,Harry, And...who owned that wand?
Gryffindor,Harry, Wow.
Gryffindor,Harry," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Gryffindor,Harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?
Gryffindor,Harry, Voldemort?
Gryffindor,Harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Gryffindor,Harry, What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?
Gryffindor,Harry," Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}"
Gryffindor,Harry," Excuse me, excuse me."
Gryffindor,Harry," Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Muggles?
Gryffindor,Harry, Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to
Gryffindor,Harry," No, not at all."
Gryffindor,Harry, I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
Gryffindor,Harry, The what?
Gryffindor,Harry," Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}"
Gryffindor,Harry, {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!
Gryffindor,Harry, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Gryffindor,Harry," {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Hey, I got Dumbledore!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Hey, he's gone!"
Gryffindor,Harry, Just a little bit.
Gryffindor,Harry, Yeah!
Gryffindor,Harry," Hey, Hagrid."
Gryffindor,Harry," I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Gryffindor,Harry, Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}
Gryffindor,Harry," Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine."
Gryffindor,Harry, {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Gryffindor,Harry, Wow.
Gryffindor,Harry," Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
Gryffindor,Harry, What's he teach?
Gryffindor,Harry, I think she fancies you.
Gryffindor,Harry, We got lost.
Gryffindor,Harry," I don't know, Sir."
Gryffindor,Harry," I don't know, Sir."
Gryffindor,Harry, What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Gryffindor,Harry, Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.
Gryffindor,Harry," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
Gryffindor,Harry, Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}
Gryffindor,Harry, Neville! {shouting}
Gryffindor,Harry," Give it here, Malfoy."
Gryffindor,Harry," Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
Gryffindor,Harry," A century, according to McGonagall."
Gryffindor,Harry, But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Gryffindor,Harry, I-I didn't know.
Gryffindor,Harry, Who doesn't?
Gryffindor,Harry, What's happening?
Gryffindor,Harry, {taps Ron} Let's go this way.
Gryffindor,Harry, Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Gryffindor,Harry, Let's go.
Gryffindor,Harry, Run!
Gryffindor,Harry, It's locked!
Gryffindor,Harry," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}"
Gryffindor,Harry, Guarding something?
Gryffindor,Harry, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}
Gryffindor,Harry, I like this ball.
Gryffindor,Harry, What do I do with it?
Gryffindor,Harry, Whoa.
Gryffindor,Harry," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
Gryffindor,Harry, I think she heard you.
Gryffindor,Harry, Where's Hermione?
Gryffindor,Harry, How could a troll get in?
Gryffindor,Harry, Hermione! She doesn't know!
Gryffindor,Harry, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Gryffindor,Harry," Hermione, move!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}"
Gryffindor,Harry," Whoa, whoa whoa!"
Gryffindor,Harry, Do something! {swipe}
Gryffindor,Harry, Anything! Hurry up!
Gryffindor,Harry, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.
Gryffindor,Harry, I'm not hungry.
Gryffindor,Harry, That explains the blood.
Gryffindor,Harry," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
Gryffindor,Harry," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
Gryffindor,Harry, That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
Gryffindor,Harry, But I-I never get mail.
Gryffindor,Harry, It's a broomstick!
Gryffindor,Harry, But who...?
Gryffindor,Harry, A little bit.
Gryffindor,Harry, What happened?
Gryffindor,Harry, Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!
Gryffindor,Harry, Yes!
Gryffindor,Harry, Whoa! Whooa!
Gryffindor,Harry, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
Gryffindor,Harry, Yes?
Gryffindor,Harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!"
Gryffindor,Harry, Exactly.
Gryffindor,Harry, Nicholas Flamel?
Gryffindor,Harry, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Gryffindor,Harry, Knight to E-5.
Gryffindor,Harry," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?"
Gryffindor,Harry, I've got presents?
Gryffindor,Harry, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}
Gryffindor,Harry," ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."""
Gryffindor,Harry, Some kind of...cloak.
Gryffindor,Harry, My body's gone!
Gryffindor,Harry, I'm invisible??
Gryffindor,Harry," {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well."""
Gryffindor,Harry, {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Gryffindor,Harry," Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there."
Gryffindor,Harry," Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
Gryffindor,Harry," There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
Gryffindor,Harry," Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
Gryffindor,Harry," {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
Gryffindor,Harry, How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}
Gryffindor,Harry," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Shh!
Gryffindor,Harry, Hagrid!
Gryffindor,Harry, We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Gryffindor,Harry," Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
Gryffindor,Harry, What?
Gryffindor,Harry," Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?"
Gryffindor,Harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Norbert?
Gryffindor,Harry, Malfoy.
Gryffindor,Harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Gryffindor,Harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?
Gryffindor,Harry, 50?!
Gryffindor,Harry," Hagrid, what's that?"
Gryffindor,Harry," If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
Gryffindor,Harry," What is it, Fang?"
Gryffindor,Harry, {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?
Gryffindor,Harry, But who would choose such a life?
Gryffindor,Harry, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Gryffindor,Harry, The Philosopher's Stone.
Gryffindor,Harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}"
Gryffindor,Harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight."
Gryffindor,Harry, My scar. It keeps burning.
Gryffindor,Harry, Not like this.
Gryffindor,Harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}"
Gryffindor,Harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?"
Gryffindor,Harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
Gryffindor,Harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Gryffindor,Harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
Gryffindor,Harry, He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
Gryffindor,Harry, Someone's going to try and steal it.
Gryffindor,Harry," That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
Gryffindor,Harry, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Gryffindor,Harry, Trevor.
Gryffindor,Harry," Now, Neville, listen. We were"
Gryffindor,Harry, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.
Gryffindor,Harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}
Gryffindor,Harry, We have to move its paw.
Gryffindor,Harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}
Gryffindor,Harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}
Gryffindor,Harry, Hermione! Where are you?!
Gryffindor,Harry," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Gryffindor,Harry, Apparently not.
Gryffindor,Harry, What?
Gryffindor,Harry," Ron, are you okay?"
Gryffindor,Harry, Okay.
Gryffindor,Harry, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Gryffindor,Harry, I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Gryffindor,Harry," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}"
Gryffindor,Harry, I don't know. Strange.
Gryffindor,Harry, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}
Gryffindor,Harry, It's too simple.
Gryffindor,Harry, Catch the key!
Gryffindor,Harry, Where are we? A graveyard.
Gryffindor,Harry, There's the door.
Gryffindor,Harry, Wait a minute.
Gryffindor,Harry," No, Ron! No!"
Gryffindor,Harry, He's going to sacrifice himself!
Gryffindor,Harry," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
Gryffindor,Harry, Not as good as you.
Gryffindor,Harry, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
Gryffindor,Harry," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me."
Gryffindor,Harry, Snape was trying to...save me?
Gryffindor,Harry, Th-then you let the troll in.
Gryffindor,Harry, I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.
Gryffindor,Harry, Voldemort.
Gryffindor,Harry, {shakes his head} Never!
Gryffindor,Harry, You liar!
Gryffindor,Harry," Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}"
Gryffindor,Harry, Admirers?
Gryffindor,Harry, Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Gryffindor,Harry," But, what happened to the Stone?"
Gryffindor,Harry," But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
Gryffindor,Harry," How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
Gryffindor,Harry," Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
Gryffindor,Harry, What is it?
Gryffindor,Harry," All right there, Ron?"
Gryffindor,Harry, {shrug} All right. Hermione?
Gryffindor,Harry, {Pats} Good job.
Gryffindor,Harry, One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}
Gryffindor,Harry," Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}"
Gryffindor,Harry," But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
Gryffindor,Harry, I'm not going home. Not really.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
Gryffindor,Hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
Gryffindor,Hermione," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}"
Gryffindor,Hermione," It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts A History."
Gryffindor,Hermione," Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}"
Gryffindor,Hermione, Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Gryffindor,Hermione, Eugh.
Gryffindor,Hermione," I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Up. Up. Up. Up.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot."
Gryffindor,Hermione, You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
Gryffindor,Hermione, {Gasps.}
Gryffindor,Hermione," The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}"
Gryffindor,Hermione, We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}"
Gryffindor,Hermione," Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Filch is gone.
Gryffindor,Hermione, It was locked.
Gryffindor,Hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
Gryffindor,Hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}"
Gryffindor,Hermione," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
Gryffindor,Hermione, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}
Gryffindor,Hermione, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}
Gryffindor,Hermione, Ahhh! Help!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Swish and flick!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Is it...dead?
Gryffindor,Hermione," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}"
Gryffindor,Hermione, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Blood?
Gryffindor,Hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?
Gryffindor,Hermione, So you're saying...
Gryffindor,Hermione," Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}
Gryffindor,Hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Whoo-hoo!
Gryffindor,Hermione, That thing has a name?
Gryffindor,Hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking."
Gryffindor,Hermione, I don't know.
Gryffindor,Hermione, That's totally barbaric!
Gryffindor,Hermione, See you haven't.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}
Gryffindor,Hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Gryffindor,Hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
Gryffindor,Hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
Gryffindor,Hermione, It means you'll never die.
Gryffindor,Hermione," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
Gryffindor,Hermione," {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Is that...a dragon?
Gryffindor,Hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Harry!
Gryffindor,Hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
Gryffindor,Hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
Gryffindor,Hermione, It's happened before.
Gryffindor,Hermione, What is it?
Gryffindor,Hermione, And with Dumbledore gone
Gryffindor,Hermione, Uh...we were just...
Gryffindor,Hermione, Now what do we do?
Gryffindor,Hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Sorry.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Ow! You stood on my foot!
Gryffindor,Hermione, Alohomora.
Gryffindor,Hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.
Gryffindor,Hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
Gryffindor,Hermione, Are you okay?
Gryffindor,Hermione," He's not relaxing, is he?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, We've got to do something!
Gryffindor,Hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}"
Gryffindor,Hermione, What is that?
Gryffindor,Hermione, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Gryffindor,Hermione, What's this all about?
Gryffindor,Hermione, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
Gryffindor,Hermione," What's wrong, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Gryffindor,Hermione, Now what do we do?
Gryffindor,Hermione, What happens now?
Gryffindor,Hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
Gryffindor,Hermione, What is it?
Gryffindor,Hermione," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!"
Gryffindor,Hermione," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
Gryffindor,Hermione," {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
Gryffindor,Hermione, {smile} Never better.
Gryffindor,Hermione, We're tied with Slytherin!
Gryffindor,Hermione," Come on, Harry."
Gryffindor,Hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
Ravenclaw,Hooch," Good afternoon, class."
Ravenclaw,Hooch," Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!"
Ravenclaw,Hooch, With feeling!
Ravenclaw,Hooch," Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}"
Ravenclaw,Hooch, Mr. Longbottom.
Ravenclaw,Hooch, {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!
Ravenclaw,Hooch, Mr. Longbottom!
Ravenclaw,Hooch, Come back down this instant!
Ravenclaw,Hooch, Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}
Ravenclaw,Hooch," Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up."
Ravenclaw,Hooch," Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}"
Ravenclaw,Hooch," Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}"
Ravenclaw,Hooch, {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!
Gryffindor,Lee," Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
Gryffindor,Lee, The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Gryffindor,Lee," The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
Gryffindor,Lee, The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Gryffindor,Lee, Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}
Gryffindor,Lee, Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Gryffindor,Lee, Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}
Gryffindor,Lee, He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Gryffindor,Lee," Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}"
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
Gryffindor,McGonagall, And the boy?
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are"
Gryffindor,McGonagall, This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup"
Gryffindor,McGonagall, The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}
Gryffindor,McGonagall, We're ready for you now.
Gryffindor,McGonagall," All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words."
Gryffindor,McGonagall," When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Draco Malfoy.
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Susan Bones.
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Ronald Weasley.
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Harry Potter.
Gryffindor,McGonagall," {dings on a cup} Your attention, please."
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time."
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
Gryffindor,McGonagall, {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Ms. Granger?
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}"
Gryffindor,McGonagall, {Giggles happily}
Gryffindor,McGonagall, Good evening.
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
Gryffindor,McGonagall," Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
Gryffindor,McGonagall," No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
Gryffindor,McGonagall, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
Gryffindor,McGonagall, {shocked} How do you know
Gryffindor,McGonagall," I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}"
Gryffindor,Neville, Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}
Gryffindor,Neville," Seamus, that picture's moving!"
Gryffindor,Neville," The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
Gryffindor,Neville, Oh...
Gryffindor,Neville, AHH!
Gryffindor,Neville, {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!
Gryffindor,Neville, Help!!!
Gryffindor,Neville, AHH!
Gryffindor,Neville, Help!
Gryffindor,Neville," Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!"
Gryffindor,Neville, Owowowow.
Gryffindor,Neville, Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
Gryffindor,Neville," {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
Gryffindor,Neville, No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}
Gryffindor,Nick, Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
Gryffindor,Nick," Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}"
Gryffindor,Nick, I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
Gryffindor,Nick, Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}
Gryffindor,Nick, Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.
Gryffindor,OIiver," Scared, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Oliver," Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?"
Gryffindor,Oliver," ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}"
Gryffindor,Oliver," Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
Gryffindor,Oliver," You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
Gryffindor,Oliver, That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Gryffindor,Oliver," Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
Ravenclaw,Ollivander," I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave."
Ravenclaw,Ollivander," Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious."
Ravenclaw,Ollivander," I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}"
Ravenclaw,Ollivander," Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}"
Gryffindor,Percy," Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
Gryffindor,Percy, Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.
Gryffindor,Percy," Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
Gryffindor,Percy," Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you."
Gryffindor,Percy," This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
Gryffindor,Percy," Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}"
Gryffindor,Percy," Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
Gryffindor,Percy," {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
Gryffindor,Percy, Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!
No Entry,Petunia, Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}
No Entry,Petunia," Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
No Entry,Petunia," Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
No Entry,Petunia, I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
No Entry,Petunia," Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?"
No Entry,Petunia, This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
No Entry,Petunia, {Sees him} AHH!
No Entry,Petunia, My darling boy! How did you get in there?!
No Entry,Petunia, It's all right. It's all right.
No Entry,Petunia," Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
No Entry,Petunia, Ooh.
No Entry,Petunia," Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you."
No Entry,Petunia, We had to tell him something.
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry You wait here.} an essential in-gredient
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}"
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, Severus...I-I thought...
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, W-what do you m-mean?
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"""
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse."
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," Come here, Potter, now!"
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, Tell me. What do you see?
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, What is it?! What do you see?!
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," Master, you are not strong enough."
Hufflepuff,Quirrell, Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}
Hufflepuff,Quirrell," {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
Gryffindor,Ron," {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
Gryffindor,Ron," So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the..."
Gryffindor,Ron, {whispers} Scar...?
Gryffindor,Ron, Wicked.
Gryffindor,Ron," {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}"
Gryffindor,Ron, Whoa!
Gryffindor,Ron," They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
Gryffindor,Ron," It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself."
Gryffindor,Ron," Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
Gryffindor,Ron, I got about 6 of him.
Gryffindor,Ron," Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?"
Gryffindor,Ron, Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Gryffindor,Ron, {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-
Gryffindor,Ron, No.
Gryffindor,Ron," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
Gryffindor,Ron, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.
Gryffindor,Ron, Whoaa!
Gryffindor,Ron, Wicked.
Gryffindor,Ron," Mental that one, I'm telling you."
Gryffindor,Ron, There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.
Gryffindor,Ron," Harry, what is it?"
Gryffindor,Ron, {Sighs}
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh!
Gryffindor,Ron," Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh!
Gryffindor,Ron," Look at that one, Harry!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?"
Gryffindor,Ron, That was bloody brilliant.
Gryffindor,Ron," Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before..."
Gryffindor,Ron, Ah. Mail's here!
Gryffindor,Ron," Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}"
Gryffindor,Ron, Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
Gryffindor,Ron," Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
Gryffindor,Ron," Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}"
Gryffindor,Ron," Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
Gryffindor,Ron," I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh!
Gryffindor,Ron," Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}"
Gryffindor,Ron, It's Filch's cat!
Gryffindor,Ron," That's it, we're done for!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Alohomora?
Gryffindor,Ron, Probably thinks this door's locked.
Gryffindor,Ron, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Gryffindor,Ron," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}"
Gryffindor,Ron, She needs to sort out her priorities!
Gryffindor,Ron, Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}
Gryffindor,Ron," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
Gryffindor,Ron," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?"
Gryffindor,Ron," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}"
Gryffindor,Ron, Ew.
Gryffindor,Ron, What? {swipe}
Gryffindor,Ron," Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron Cool.) It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard."
Gryffindor,Ron," Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
Gryffindor,Ron, Let's open it.
Gryffindor,Ron," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Gryffindor,Ron," Come on, Hermione!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Go!
Gryffindor,Ron, Fluffy?
Gryffindor,Ron, Queen to E-5.
Gryffindor,Ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.
Gryffindor,Ron," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!"
Gryffindor,Ron, We've looked a hundred times!
Gryffindor,Ron, I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Gryffindor,Ron," {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Happy Christmas, Harry."
Gryffindor,Ron," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Yeah!
Gryffindor,Ron, There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}
Gryffindor,Ron, What is it?
Gryffindor,Ron," Well, let's see then. Put it on."
Gryffindor,Ron, Whoa!
Gryffindor,Ron, I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!
Gryffindor,Ron, {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.
Gryffindor,Ron, Why?
Gryffindor,Ron, I only see me.
Gryffindor,Ron," That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
Gryffindor,Ron, This is light?
Gryffindor,Ron, Immortal?
Gryffindor,Ron, I know what it means!
Gryffindor,Ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
Gryffindor,Ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Gryffindor,Ron, {laughs}
Gryffindor,Ron," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
Gryffindor,Ron, It's bad.
Gryffindor,Ron, {weakly} Okay.
Gryffindor,Ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?"
Gryffindor,Ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
Gryffindor,Ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Gryffindor,Ron," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
Gryffindor,Ron," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
Gryffindor,Ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}"
Gryffindor,Ron, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}
Gryffindor,Ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping."
Gryffindor,Ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!
Gryffindor,Ron, What?!
Gryffindor,Ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}"
Gryffindor,Ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
Gryffindor,Ron," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
Gryffindor,Ron, Now what are we gonna do?!
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahh! Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron, Harry!
Gryffindor,Ron, Help!
Gryffindor,Ron, Help! Help me!
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahhh!
Gryffindor,Ron, Yeah.
Gryffindor,Ron, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Gryffindor,Ron," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try."
Gryffindor,Ron, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
Gryffindor,Ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
Gryffindor,Ron, This complicates things a bit!
Gryffindor,Ron, Hurry up!
Gryffindor,Ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}"
Gryffindor,Ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}"
Gryffindor,Ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}"
Gryffindor,Ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
Gryffindor,Ron," Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
Gryffindor,Ron," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
Gryffindor,Ron," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3."
Gryffindor,Ron, Check.
Gryffindor,Ron, Ahhhh!
Gryffindor,Ron, All right? You?
Gryffindor,Seamus, I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Gryffindor,Seamus," Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
Gryffindor,Seamus," Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
Gryffindor,Seamus," Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione Well done, dear.}"
Gryffindor,Seamus, Neville! {Shakes his hand.}
Slytherin,Snake, Thankssssssss.
Slytherin,Snape," There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention."
Slytherin,Snape," Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}"
Slytherin,Snape, And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?
Slytherin,Snape," Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?"
Slytherin,Snape," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}"
Slytherin,Snape," What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}"
Slytherin,Snape," You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
Slytherin,Snape," You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
Slytherin,Snape," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
Slytherin,Snape," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}"
No Entry,Tom, Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
No Entry,Vernon," Happy birthday, son."
No Entry,Vernon," Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
No Entry,Vernon, Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
No Entry,Vernon," Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!"
No Entry,Vernon," I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
No Entry,Vernon, Move!
No Entry,Vernon, What happened?
No Entry,Vernon, {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!
No Entry,Vernon," Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk."
No Entry,Vernon, {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
No Entry,Vernon, No more mail through this letterbox.
No Entry,Vernon, Shoo! Go on!
No Entry,Vernon," Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
No Entry,Vernon," Go away, ahh!"
No Entry,Vernon, Give me that! Give me that letter!
No Entry,Vernon, Ahh!
No Entry,Vernon, That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
No Entry,Vernon, Who's there? Ahh!
No Entry,Vernon," I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!"
No Entry,Vernon, Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!
No Entry,Vernon, He'll not be going!
No Entry,Vernon, I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Slytherin,Voldemort," Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!"
Slytherin,Voldemort, Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Slytherin,Voldemort," Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}"
Slytherin,Voldemort, Kill him!
Slytherin,Voldemort, Fool! Get the stone!
Slytherin,Voldemort, Arrrhhhhhh!
