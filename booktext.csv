"dudley","chamber_of_secrets",18,153,"  ""Today's your birthday,"" sneered Dudley."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",18,156,"  ""Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,"" said Harry coolly."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",18,160," ""I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,"" said Harry."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,8," ""Er - hello,"" said Harry nervously."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,16,"  ""Th-thank you,"" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage."

"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,35,"  ""Sit down,"" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,49," ""You can't have met many decent wizards,"" said Harry, trying to cheer him up."
"dobby","chamber_of_secrets",19,96," ""I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest,"" said Dobby reverently, his orb- like eyes aglow."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,101,"  ""Sorry"" said Harry quickly."
"dobby","chamber_of_secrets",19,122,"  ""No, no, no,"" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped."
"dobby","chamber_of_secrets",19,129,"A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,"" whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,150," ""Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,"" said Harry."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,178," ""I expect they've just been - wait a minute,"" said Harry, frowning."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,197,"  ""No,"" said Harry angrily."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,225,"(""Just our nephew - very disturbed  meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs	) He  shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma sons had left, and handed him a mop."
"uncle","chamber_of_secrets",19,242," ""You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,"" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,269," ""It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got,"" said Harry grimly."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",19,278,"He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, ""Harry Potter is safe there, sir!"""
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,1,"THE BURROW  Ron.l"" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,11,"  ""He works for the Ministry,"" said Ron."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,12,"""You know we're not supposed to do spells outside school -""  ""You should talk,"" said Harry, staring at the floating car."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,13," ""Oh, this doesn't count,"" said Ron."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,16,"But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with -""  ""I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -""  ""Stop gibbering,"" said Ron."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,18,"  ""But you can't magic me out either -""  ""We don't need to,"" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,20,"  ""Tie that around the bars,"" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,21," ""If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead,"" said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,22," ""Don't worry,"" said Fred, ""and stand back."""
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,31,"   ""Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this room -""  ""No problem,"" said George from the front passenger seat."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,35," ""A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,"" said Fred, ""but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow."""
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,37," ""So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,"" whispered George."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,68," ""Let Hedwig out,"" he told Ron."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,77," ""Very fishy,"" said Fred finally."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,78," ""Definitely dodgy"" agreed George."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,80,"  ""I don't think he could,"" said Harry."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,85," ""Well,"" said Fred, ""put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's permission."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,89,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry and Ron together, instantly."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,97,"  Y.  ""I've heard Dad talking about him,"" said George."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,99,"  ""And when You-Know-Who disappeared,"" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, ""Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,103," ""I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf	said  Harry."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,104," ""Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich,"" said Fred."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,105," ""Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,"" said George."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,115," ""I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,"" said Ron."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,122,"  ""The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,"" said Fred from the front."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,123," ""But Percy wouldn't lend him to me,"" said Ron."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,125,"  ""Percy's been acting very oddly this summer,"" said George, frowning."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,132," ""Er, no,"" said Ron, ""he had to work tonight."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,135,"  ""He works in the most boring department,"" said Ron."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,149,"  ""That's the main road,"" said George, peering down through the windshield."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,157," ""We're a little way outside the village,"" said George."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,169," ""It's not much,"" said Ron."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,170," ""It's wonderful,"" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,172," ""Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,"" said Fred, ""and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, `Mum, look who turned up in the night!'"
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,174,"  ""Right,"" said Ron."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,178," ""Ah, ""said Fred."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,179," ""Oh, dear,"" said George."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,183," ""Morning, Mum,"" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,190,"- never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -""  ""Perfect Percy,"" muttered Fred."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",20,207,"  ""I don't blame you, dear,"" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,220," ""Ginny,"" said Ron in an undertone to Harry."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,225," ""Blimey, I'm tired,"" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,244,"  ""Mum fancies him,"" said Fred, in a very audible whisper."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,250," ""Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,"" Harry told Ron  they crossed the lawn."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,251," ""Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,"" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, ""like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods ."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",20,268," ""Pitiful,"" said Fred."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",20,273," ""See, they're not too bright,"" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,277," ""They'll be back,"" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,338," ""Ginny,"" said Ron."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,346," ""The Chudley Cannons,"" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",20,353," ""It's a bit small,"" said Ron quickly."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",21,28," ""That lot won't come cheap,"" said George, with a quick look at his parents."
"percy","chamber_of_secrets",21,37," ""Morning, all,"" said Percy briskly."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",21,63," ""Wish I knew what he was up to,"" said Fred, frowning."
"george","chamber_of_secrets",21,73," ""Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,"" said George after a while."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",21,91," ""He's never traveled by Floo powder,"" said Ron suddenly."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",21,100,"""Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -""  ""He'll be all right, Mum,"" said Fred."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",21,105," * 41  ""You must speak clearly, dear,"" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot."

"draco","chamber_of_secrets",21,180,"  ""I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,"" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, ""No offense, sir, no offense meant -""  ""Though if his grades don't pick up,"" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, ""that may indeed be all he is fit for -""  ""It's not my fault,"" retorted Draco."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",21,228,"""Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -""  ""I realized that,"" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again."

"ron","chamber_of_secrets",21,261," ""We've never been allowed in,"" said Ron enviously."
"harry","chamber_of_secrets",21,318,""" Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",21,343,"""This is for the Daily Prophet -""  ""Big deal,"" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it."
"malfoy","chamber_of_secrets",21,369," ""Famous Harry Potter,"" said Malfoy."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",21,378," ""Oh, it's you,"" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe."
"malfoy","chamber_of_secrets",21,380,"  ""Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,"" retorted Malfoy."
"fred","chamber_of_secrets",21,422,"what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought -""  ""He was pleased,"" said Fred."

"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,65," ""Check that no one's watching,"" said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,74," ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,82," ""We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,"" said Ron."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,88," ""Due north,"" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,92,"The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.  ""All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,"" said Ron."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,110," ""It's probably just tired,"" said Ron."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,115,"""Not far,"" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, ""not far now,"" and he patted the dashboard nervously."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,132," ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron, into the silence."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,146," ""My wand,"" said Ron, in a shaky voice."
"ron","chamber_of_secrets",22,155,"said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving  ""Run for it!"""

"professor","chamber_of_secrets",26,252,"  ""That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,"" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice."

"harry","chamber_of_secrets",26,285," ""That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect,"" said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch- Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime."

"ron","goblet_of_fire",63,87,"  ""Only, most of the stuff - well, all of it, really - was a bit dangerous,"" said Ron, ""and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",63,94," ""Hi, Percy,"" said Harry."
"percy","goblet_of_fire",63,95," ""Oh hello, Harry,"" said Percy."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",63,98,"  ""We're not thundering, ""said Ron irritably."
"percy","goblet_of_fire",63,103," ""A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,"" said Percy smugly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",63,105,"Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year -""  ""That'll change the world, that report will,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",63,108," ""You might sneer, Ron,"" he said heatedly, ""but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger -""  ""Yeah, yeah, all right,"" said Ron, and he started off upstairs again."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",63,115," ""Shut up, Pig,"" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",63,116,"""Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,"" he told Harry."

"hermione","goblet_of_fire",63,159," ""I think they've stopped arguing,"" said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry."

"bill","goblet_of_fire",63,200," ""Sorry, Perce,"" said Bill, grinning."
"percy","goblet_of_fire",63,202,"  ""Very badly,"" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut."
"percy","goblet_of_fire",63,214,"  ""Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course,"" said Percy dismissively, ""but how he ever got to be Head of Department ..."
"percy","goblet_of_fire",63,224,"  ""Oh Bertha's hopeless, all right,"" said Percy."

"harry","goblet_of_fire",65,183," ""Let's go and have a look,"" said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield, where the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red - was fluttering in the breeze."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",65,186," ""Krum,"" said Ron quietly."

"george","goblet_of_fire",71,355,"  ""Beyond cool,"" said George, sitting down opposite Fred."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",71,357,"""We had him this afternoon,"" he told Harry and Ron."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",71,361," ""Never had a lesson like it,"" said Fred."
"lee","goblet_of_fire",71,362," ""He knows, man,"" said Lee."
"george","goblet_of_fire",71,365," ""Knows what it's like to be out there doing it,"" said George impressively."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",71,368," ""Fighting the Dark Arts,"" said Fred."
"george","goblet_of_fire",71,369," ""He's seen it all,"" said George."
"lee","goblet_of_fire",71,370," ""Mazing,"" said Lee."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",72,5," ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,11," ""Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,"" said Ron, his eyes misting over, ""and bounced him all around his dungeon..."""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,68," ""Er,"" said Ron tentatively, ""my dad told me about one.."
"neville","goblet_of_fire",72,107," ""There's one - the Cruciatus Curse,"" said Neville in a small but distinct voice."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,221," ""No,"" said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",72,251,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry, almost defiantly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,264," ""I don't know,"" said Hermione, looking pensive."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,274," ""Yeah, probably,"" said Ron."
"neville","goblet_of_fire",72,287," ""Oh yes,"" said Neville, ""I'm fine, thanks."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",72,292," ""Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology,"" Neville said."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,300," ""You know,"" said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, ""I think it's back to the old Divination standby."""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,302,"  ""Yeah,"" said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",72,306,"  ""Right,"" said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,311,"  ""Yeah, you will be,"" said Ron darkly, ""we're seeing the skrewts again on Monday."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",72,317," ""Lose a treasured possession,"" said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,318," ""Good one,"" said Ron, copying it down."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",72,331,"said Harry, scribbling it down, ""because..."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,361," ""You seem to be drowning twice,"" said Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,371," ""It's just an expression,"" said Ron hastily."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,375," ""Funny you should ask,"" said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,380,"  ""Not spew,"" said Hermione impatiently."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,383,"  ""Never heard of it,"" said Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,384," ""Well, of course you haven't,"" said Hermione briskly, ""I've only just started it."""
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,388,"  ""Well - if you two join - three,"" said Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",72,399,"  ""Hermione - open your ears,"" said Ron loudly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,404,"  ""Our short-term aims,"" said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, ""are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",72,408," ""We start by recruiting members,"" said Hermione happily."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",72,450," ""I'm going to bed,"" said Harry shortly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,21," ""That was a lie, Harry,"" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",73,26,"  ""Drop it,"" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,32," ""But - but you said it's illegal, Professor,"" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",73,84,"  ""Yeah, I know,"" said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step."
"draco","goblet_of_fire",73,112," ""I will not,"" said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",73,138," ""Diggory,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,143,"You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,""  said Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",73,146," ""You only like him because he's handsome,"" said Ron scathingly."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",73,171," ""Wish you would,"" said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption."
"george","goblet_of_fire",73,174," ""Having a nosy git like you for a brother,"" said George."
"george","goblet_of_fire",73,178,"  ""I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn't telling,"" said George bitterly."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",73,187,"  ""Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven't,"" said Fred."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,191," ""Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,"" said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, ""because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage."""
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,214,"  ""No, of course not,"" said Hermione curtly, ""I hardly think students are supposed to -""  ""Well, we have,"" said George, indicating Fred, ""loads of times, to nick food."
"george","goblet_of_fire",73,214,"  ""No, of course not,"" said Hermione curtly, ""I hardly think students are supposed to -""  ""Well, we have,"" said George, indicating Fred, ""loads of times, to nick food."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,228," ""Hedwig'll attract too much attention,"" said Hermione at once."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",73,246," ""Follow me, please,"" said Professor McGonagall."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",73,255," ""Nearly six,"" said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,258,"  ""I doubt it,"" said Hermione."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",73,322,"  ""In excellent form, I thank you,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",73,330," ""He should be here any moment,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",73,333,"""But ze 'orses -""  ""Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,"" said Dumbledore, ""the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other - er - charges."""
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",73,340,"  ""I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,"" said Dumbledore, smiling."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",73,343,"  ""It will be attended to,"" said Dumbledore, also bowing."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",73,347," ""Well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won't be able to handle them,""  said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",73,350,"  ""Maybe they've escaped,"" said Ron hopefully."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",73,351," ""Oh don't say that,"" said Hermione with a shudder."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,5,"  ""For heaven's sake, Ron, he's only a Quidditch player,"" said Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,13," ""I'm getting his autograph if I can,"" said Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,15,"  ""Nope, they're upstairs in my bag,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,21," ""It's not that cold,"" said Hermione defensively."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,28,"  ""Too late,"" said Ron bitterly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,32," ""Yeah, that's right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,"" said Ron scathingly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,45," ""They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,61," ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and - most particularly - guests,"" said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,67," ""The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,"" said Dumbledore."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,74," ""Bouillabaisse,"" said Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,75," ""Bless you,"" said Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,76," ""It's French,"" said Hermione, ""I had it on holiday summer before last."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,78,"  ""I'll take your word for it,"" said Ron, helping himself to black pudding."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,86," ""Yeah, I'll just bet they are,"" said Ron quietly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,96," ""Yeah, have it,"" said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,114,"  ""They make them okay at Hogwarts,"" said Harry without thinking."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,116," ""When you've both put your eyes back in,"" said Hermione briskly, ""you'll be able to see who's just arrived."""
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,132," ""The moment has come,"" said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,150," ""The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,"" said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, ""and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,162," ""Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,166," ""To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,"" said Dumbledore, ""I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,179,"  ""But I don't think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,"" said Hermione, ""we just haven't learned enough."
"george","goblet_of_fire",74,182,"  ""Speak for yourself,"" said George shortly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,231,"  ""Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,"" said Harry."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",74,243," ""The Aging Potion, dung brains,"" said Fred."
"george","goblet_of_fire",74,244," ""One drop each,"" said George, rubbing his hands together with glee."
"lee","goblet_of_fire",74,246,"  ""We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,""  said Lee, grinning broadly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,247," ""I'm not sure this is going to work, you know,"" said Hermione warningly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,268," ""There's a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,"" Dean told Harry."
"seamus","goblet_of_fire",74,272,"  ""And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,"" said Seamus contemptuously."
"angelina","goblet_of_fire",74,286," ""I had my birthday last week,"" said Angelina."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",74,287," ""Well, I'm glad someone from Gryffindor's entering,"" said Hermione."
"angelina","goblet_of_fire",74,289,"  ""Thanks, Hermione,"" said Angelina, smiling at her."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,293," ""We haven't been down to visit Hagrid yet,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,294," ""Okay,"" said Ron, ""just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts."""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,301," ""Hey, Ron,"" said Harry suddenly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",74,313,"  ""Dunno,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,321," ""Oh good, hurry up,"" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,343,"  ""Well, that's lucky,"" said Ron."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",74,419," ""Hope it's Angelina,"" said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,430," ""Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",74,457," ""The champion for Beauxbatons,"" said Dumbledore, ""is Fleur Delacour!"""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",74,468,""" said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",75,26,"through the door, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",75,99,"""I'd rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,"" said Professor Karkaroff."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",75,109,"  ""It's no one's fault but Potter's, Karkaroff,"" said Snape softly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",75,112,"He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here -""  ""Thank you, Severus,"" said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,116," ""No,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,121," ""No,"" said Harry vehemently."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",75,125," ""He could not have crossed the Age Line,"" said Professor McGonagall sharply."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",75,127," ""It is possible, of course,"" said Dumbledore politely."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",75,222," ""How this situation arose, we do not know,"" said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,247," ""The first task is designed to test your daring,"" he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, ""so we are not going to be telling you what it is."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",75,259,"  ""I think so,"" said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild concern."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",75,283," ""Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,"" said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",75,287," ""So,"" said Cedric, with a slight smile."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,289,"  ""I s'pose,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,300,"  ""I didn't,"" said Harry, staring up at him."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",75,306,"okay,"" said Cedric."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,364,"  ""Balderdash,"" said Harry dully."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",75,398," ""Oh hello,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",75,411,"no one else got across the Age Line,"" said Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,414,"  ""The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line,"" said Harry slowly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",75,415," ""Oh right,"" said Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,421,"  ""Listen,"" said Harry, ""I didn't put my name in that goblet."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",75,425,"  ""I dunno,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",75,437," ""Yeah, okay,"" said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,14,"  ""Good idea,"" said Harry gratefully."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,42,"not really,"" said Hermione awkwardly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,51,"  ""Look,"" said Hermione patiently, ""it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,58," ""Great,"" said Harry bitterly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,70,"""Maybe he'll believe I'm not enjoying myself once I've got my neck broken or -""  ""That's not funny,"" said Hermione quietly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,82,"I brought some parchment and a quill out with me -""  ""Come off it,"" said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn't be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,84,"He'll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone's entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -""  ""He'd want you to tell him,"" said Hermione sternly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,87,"  ""Harry, this isn't going to be kept quiet,"" said Hermione, very seriously."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,96,"  ""Okay, okay, I'll write to him,"" said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,103," ""Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,"" said Hermione."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",76,109,"He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you're okay, and Buckbeak - Harry ""Finished,"" he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,161,"  ""Wish I knew who did do it,"" said Harry bitterly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,195,"""You just weren't concentrating properly -""  ""Wonder why that was,"" said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",76,286," ""Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,"" said Snape coldly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,308,"  ""Yeah, really amazing,"" said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,311,"  ""Great,"" said Harry dully."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",76,337,"  ""Maybe not that small, Ludo,"" said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,350,"  ""Er -"" said Harry."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",76,351," ""Lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry's upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",76,359," ""Come along, dear - that's right - lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",76,377,"The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:  Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, who's savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations - ""Lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,380,"  ""Er -"" said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",76,381,"Even though he wasn't speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence:  An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes -- ""Ignore the quill, Harry,"" said Rita Skeeter firmly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,384,"  ""I didn't,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,400,"yeah, nervous, I suppose,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,408,"they say it's going to be a lot safer this year,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,413,"  ""Er,"" said Harry, yet again."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,416,"Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because - ""  ""I didn't enter,"" said Harry, starting to feel irritated."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,419," ""No,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",76,438,"  ""Enchantingly nasty,"" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",76,441," ""I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, Dumbhedore, and that many wizards in the street -""  ""I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,"" said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, ""but I'm afraid we will have to discuss the matter later."
"fleur","goblet_of_fire",76,470,"  ""An 'air from ze 'ead of a veela,"" said Fleur."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",76,499,"  ""Polished it last night,"" said Cedric, grinning."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",76,552," ""Thank you all,"" said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",76,557,"  ""Er - yes, let's do those first,"" said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",76,569," ""You've had an owl,"" said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",76,572," ""Oh - right,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",76,573," ""And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,"" said Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,79,"They wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that WonkyFaint thing -""  ""Wronski Feint,"" said Harry, through gritted teeth."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,99,"  ""No,"" said Harry flatly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",77,108," ""People keep looking at me now,"" said Hermione grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",77,122," ""She's gone,"" said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,139," ""Yeah, right,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,146,"  ""No idea, ask Fred and George,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",77,184," ""Hello,"" said Hermione, smiling back."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,225," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head."
"charlie","goblet_of_fire",77,310," ""This is a Hungarian Horntail,"" said Charlie."
"charlie","goblet_of_fire",77,316," ""Really romantic date, Hagrid,"" said Charlie, shaking his head."
"charlie","goblet_of_fire",77,322,"  ""Just get past them, I think,"" said Charlie."
"charlie","goblet_of_fire",77,334," ""I've got them counted, Hagrid,"" said Charlie sternly."
"charlie","goblet_of_fire",77,338," ""Just hope he's still fine after he's faced this lot,"" said Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons' enclosure."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,404,"Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, ""Sirius - how're you doing?"""
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,425," ""Karkaroff,"" said Sirius."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,436,"  ""He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,"" said Sirius bitterly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,447,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry slowly."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,455,"  ""We know he's a good actor,"" said Sirius, ""because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn't he?"
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,457,"  ""- you and the rest of the world,"" said Harry bitterly."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,493," ""Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,"" said Sirius grimly."

"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,511,"  ""Right - these dragons,"" said Sirius, speaking very quickly now."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",77,513," Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell - dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon -""  ""Yeah, I know, I just saw,"" said Harry."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",77,514," ""But you can do it alone,"" said Sirius."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",77,539," ""Sorry about that,"" said Ron, his face reddening with anger."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,22," ""Let's try some simple spellbooks, then,"" said Harry, throwing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",78,97," ""Don't bother,"" said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",78,103," ""Hi,"" said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,110,"  ""Cedric,"" said Harry, ""the first task is dragons."""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,113," ""Dragons,"" said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,119," ""Dead sure,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,126,"  ""Never mind,"" said Harry quickly - he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,198,"  ""I didn't cheat,"" said Harry sharply."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,213," ""No,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,218,"  ""I haven't got any,"" said Harry, before he could stop himself."
"dully","goblet_of_fire",78,224,"Well, that was easy, really -- ""Quidditch,"" he said dully, ""and a fat lot of help -""  ""That's right,"" said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,264," ""Well, that's good,"" said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, ""just as long as it's not drawn-out."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",78,288,"  ""That doesn't matter,"" said Hermione firmly."""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,307,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,310,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",78,330," ""You're to go in here with the other champions,"" said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, ""and wait for your turn, Potter."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,339,"  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, in a flat, distant voice."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,399,"yes,"" said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,415,"  ""No,"" said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, ""no - I - I know what I'm going to do, thanks."""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,417," ""No, I'm fine,"" said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,617,"An' agains' the Horntail an' all, an' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors' - ""  ""Thanks, Hagrid,"" said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn't blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",78,660,"  ""No,"" said Ron, ""I shouldn't've -""  ""Forget it, ""Harry said."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",78,667," ""Barking mad,"" said Ron, shaking his head."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,748,"  ""And you,"" said Harry, grinning back."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",78,770,"  ""Yeah, you can have a word,"" said Harry savagely."
"lee","goblet_of_fire",79,32," ""Blimey, this is heavy,"" said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands."
"george","goblet_of_fire",79,55,"  ""Don't be a prat, Neville, that's illegal,"" said George."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",79,74,"  ""Yep,"" said Fred, grinning at her."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",79,81," ""Easy,"" said Fred, ""concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,84,"  ""Nothing,"" said Hermione quickly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,171,"interesting,"" said Harry as she stepped on his foot."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,177,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry stoutly."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",79,179," ""Lovely,"" said Rita."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,199," ""Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,"" said Hermione desperately."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",79,201," ""Hagrids been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledores never sacked him,"" said Ron consolingly."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",79,222," ""Yes,"" said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, ""it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",79,232,"  ""You'd be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,"" said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,278," ""I know what this is about,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,332," ""Hello, Winky,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,335," ""Oh dear,"" said Hermione."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,342," ""Er - yeah, okay,"" said Harry."
"dobby","goblet_of_fire",79,387," ""Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,"" said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, ""but Dobby beat him down, miss."
"dobby","goblet_of_fire",79,408,"  ""Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,"" squeaked Dobby confidentially."
"dobby","goblet_of_fire",79,412," ""Oh no, sir, no,"" said Dobby, looking suddenly serious."
"dobby","goblet_of_fire",79,432,"Harry Potter, thank you,"" said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,448," ""Winky,"" said Hermione firmly, ""I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,452,"  ""Yes,"" said Hermione, ""he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament."""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",79,469,"he said happily, pointing at his bare chest, ""Tell you what, Dobby,"" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, ""I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,483," "" 'Course you can,"" said Harry, and Dobby beamed."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,488,"  ""I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,"" said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",79,491,"  ""Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,492," ""Oh she'll cheer up,"" said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",79,494,"  ""She seems to love him,"" said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake)."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",79,498,"  ""Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department,"" said Hermione, ""and let's face it..."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",79,500,"  ""I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch,"" said Ron."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",80,7," ""Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,"" said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - Ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before - ""I have something to say to you all."
"potter","goblet_of_fire",80,22,"Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, ""Potter, the champions and their partners -""  ""What partners?"""
"professor","goblet_of_fire",80,31," ""Oh yes, you do,"" said Professor McGonagall irritably."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",80,36," ""It is traditional,"" said Professor McGonagall firmly."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",80,39,"  ""But-I don't-""  ""You heard me, Potter,"" said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,70," ""She was quite good-looking,"" said Ron fairly, after he'd stopped laughing."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,71," ""She was a foot taller than me,"" said Harry, still unnerved."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,92,"  "" 'Course she did,"" said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,94,"  ""She wants a new angle, Hagrid,"" said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,98," ""She should've interviewed Snape,"" said Harry grimly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,108,"  ""Cheers, Hagrid,"" said Harry, grinning."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,115,"  ""No one, yet,"" said Harry, feeling himself going red again."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,136," ""It's Christmas, Hermione,"" said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,149,"  ""Leave him alone, Hermione, he's earned a bit of a break,"" said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,156," ""No, he's off delivering a letter,"" said Ron."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",80,158,"  ""Because George wants to invite him to the ball,"" said Fred sarcastically."
"george","goblet_of_fire",80,159," ""Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,"" said George."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",80,162," ""Nose out, Ron, or I'll burn that for you too,"" said Fred, waving his wand threateningly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,167,"  ""Nope,"" said Ron."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",80,168," ""Well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,"" said Fred."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",80,171," ""Angelina,"" said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",80,175,"  ""Good point,"" said Fred."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",80,184," ""There you go,"" said Fred to Harry and Ron, ""piece of cake."""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,199,"  ""Well - you know,"" said Ron, shrugging."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,202,"  ""Her nose is off-center,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,205,"  ""Er - yeah, that sounds about right,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,217," ""Harry - we've just got to grit our teeth and do it,"" said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,222,"okay,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,259,"  ""Oh,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,263," ""That's okay,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,264," They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, ""Well-""  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"cho","goblet_of_fire",80,265," ""Well, 'bye,"" said Cho, still very red."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,271,"  ""Oh right,"" said Harry."
"dully","goblet_of_fire",80,278," ""Fairy lights,"" he said dully to the Fat Lady - the password had been changed the previous day."
"ginny","goblet_of_fire",80,291," ""He - er - just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,"" said Ginny."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,305,"  ""She's part veela,"" said Harry."
"dully","goblet_of_fire",80,310," ""I asked her to go with me just now,"" Harry said dully, ""and she told me."""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,312," ""This is mad,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,334," ""Thanks a bunch, Ginny,"" said Ron sourly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",80,350,"  ""I can't come with you,"" said Hermione, now blushing, ""because I'm already going with someone."""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,366," ""She's lying,"" said Ron flatly, watching her go."
"ginny","goblet_of_fire",80,367," ""She's not,"" said Ginny quietly."
"ginny","goblet_of_fire",80,370," ""I'm not telling you, it's her business,"" said Ginny."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",80,371," ""Right,"" said Ron, who looked extremely put out, ""this is getting stupid."
"ginny","goblet_of_fire",80,372,"Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I'll just -""  ""I can't,"" said Ginny, and she went scarlet too."
"parvati","goblet_of_fire",80,388," ""Wait here,"" he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said, ""Parvati?"
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,393," ""Thanks,"" said Harry, in relief."
"parvati","goblet_of_fire",80,395,"  ""She's going with Seamus,"" said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever."
"parvati","goblet_of_fire",80,411,"said Parvati slowly, ""I suppose my sister might."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",80,417,"  ""Yeah, that would be great,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,27," ""Hermione,"" said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, ""your teeth ..."""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,82," Sirius ""He sounds exactly like Moody,"" said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away again inside his robes."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",81,86,"  ""But he's right, Harry,"" said Hermione, ""you have still got two tasks to do."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,94,"  ""Yeah, okay,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,107,"  It's okay,"" said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,127," ""'Course you can,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,152,"""Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless -""  ""They're only socks,"" said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,167,"well, thanks, Dobby,"" said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again."
"dean","goblet_of_fire",81,189," ""I still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,"" muttered Dean."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,190," ""Animal magnetism,"" said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,198," ""Right,"" said Ron, looking around."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,202,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room."
"padma","goblet_of_fire",81,207," ""Hi,"" said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,209," ""Hi,"" said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",81,290,"  ""Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts' secrets, Igor,"" said Dumbledore amicably."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,339," ""Oh - yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,"" said Harry, grinning."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,364," ""Hi,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,376," ""If you don't know,"" said Ron scathingly, ""I'm not going to tell you."""
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",81,393,"  ""Yes, he did,"" said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,399," ""Yeah, well - that's his story,"" said Ron nastily."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,416,"  ""You've got a funny way of showing it,"" sneered Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,423," ""Ron,"" said Harry quietly, ""I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum -""  But Ron ignored Harry too."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,424," ""Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,430," ""No,"" said Ron, still glaring after Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,435," ""No idea,"" said Ron mulishly, looking up at him."
"percy","goblet_of_fire",81,467,"  ""Oh I'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,"" said Percy importantly, ""but in the meantime, I'm more than willing to take up the slack."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",81,497," ""We re walking,"" Ron told Snape shortly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,622," ""I'll explain inside,"" said Ron quietly, ""c'mon. ."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",81,655,"no one who knows him will care, 'cos they'll know he's not dangerous,"" said Ron slowly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",81,698,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",82,44," ""He is indisposed,"" said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",82,48," ""This way, please,"" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,55," ""I do mind, though,"" said Harry hotly."
"malfoy","goblet_of_fire",82,77,"  ""Oh he hasn't been attacked, Potter, if that's what you're thinking,"" said Malfoy softly."
"malfoy","goblet_of_fire",82,121," ""Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career,"" said Malfoy, his eyes glinting."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",82,151," ""That was a really good lesson,"" said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,158,"  ""No,"" said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",82,161,"  ""Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,"" said Hermione quietly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",82,164,"""Anyway, she's not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,168,"  ""Maybe she's got an Invisibility Cloak,"" said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",82,170,"  ""Like you and Ron did, you mean,"" said Hermione."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,175,"  ""We've got to go and see him,"" said Harry."

"ron","goblet_of_fire",82,223,"  ""Yeah, but there's still the giant squid,"" said Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,251,"  ""Fine, thanks,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",82,255,"  ""Er - okay,"" said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,259,"  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, but he knew this couldn't be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",82,353,"  ""Have you offered Cedric help?"""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,359,"  ""Well, thanks,"" said Harry, ""but I think I'm nearly there with the egg ."

"hermione","goblet_of_fire",82,418," ""Well, the/re quite capable of dealing with wizards,"" said Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",82,421,"  ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron, staring at the door."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,448,"  ""I wouldn't come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,"" said Harry furiously."
"rita","goblet_of_fire",82,464,"Even Ludo Bagman -""  ""Sit down, you silly little girl, and don't talk about things you don't understand,"" said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione."

"ron","goblet_of_fire",82,473," ""She'll be after you next, Hermione,"" said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",82,480,"  ""You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,"" said Ron nervously."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",82,500," ""We-er-we wanted to see Hagrid,"" said Hermione in a rather small voice."

"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",82,516," ""More tea, I think,"" said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",82,524,"Harry,"" said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",82,525," ""Er-right,"" said Harry sheepishly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",82,528," ""Living proof of what I've been telling you, Hagrid,"" said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",82,531,"  ""Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I'm afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,"" said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles."

"harry","goblet_of_fire",83,48,"said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn't see anything but his head, ""I'm not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I?"

"myrtle","goblet_of_fire",83,66,"  ""Sometimes,"" said Myrtle, rather slyly, ""but I've never come out to speak to anyone before."""

"ron","goblet_of_fire",84,43,"  ""You just don't like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,"" said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",84,44," ""You just want to think Snapes up to something,"" said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,45," ""I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he's on his second one,""  said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione's."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,53,"  ""Yeah, I don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",84,55,"  ""I don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,"" said Hermione seriously."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",84,78," ""Weekend after next,"" whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harrys shoulder."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,86," ""Dunno,"" said Harry dully."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,112," ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,115," ""Bit,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",84,142,"  ""They have,"" said Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,149," ""I know what I should have done,"" said Harry, resting, face-down, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,154," ""Or a frog,"" yawned Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",84,156,"""It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything,"" said Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,160,"  ""Hermione, I was joking,"" said Harry wearily."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",84,164,"  ""I wouldn't mind,"" said Fred Weasleys voice."
"george","goblet_of_fire",84,170," ""Looking for you,"" said George."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",84,176,"she was looking a bit grim, though,"" said Fred."
"george","goblet_of_fire",84,177," ""We're supposed to take you down to her office,"" said George."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,181," ""We'll meet you back in the common room,"" Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron - both of them looked very anxious."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,183,"  ""Right,"" said Harry uneasily."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,293,"  ""Dobby,"" said Harry frantically, ""listen - are you sure about this?"""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",84,576," ""Harry, you prat,"" said Ron, ""you didn't take that song thing seriously, did you?"
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,609,"  ""Well -"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,612,"""Yeah, that's right,"" said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him."
"krum","goblet_of_fire",84,613," ""You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,"" said Krum."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",84,636,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he'd left all three girls tied to the statue."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",84,637," Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, ""And you too-you 'elped -""  ""Yeah,"" said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, ""yeah, a bit -""  Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him."
"fleur","goblet_of_fire",84,647," ""I deserved zero,"" said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head."
"padma","goblet_of_fire",85,5," ""But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,"" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,21," ""I can't believe him,"" said Harry tensely, ""if he's caught."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",85,63," ""If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch,"" said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",85,67," ""There's something funny, though,"" said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",85,129,"How very touching,"" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",85,140,"Potter,""  said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,166,"  ""Right,"" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,176," ""No,"" said Harry, with complete honesty this time."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",85,177," ""It is Veritaserum - a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,"" said Snape viciously."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",85,199," ""Enter,"" said Snape in his usual voice."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,229,"  ""Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,"" said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,246," ""Hello, Sirius,"" said Harry when they had reached him."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,265," ""Thanks,"" said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,271," ""Fulfilling my duty as godfather,"" said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,283,"  ""You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an Animagus,"" said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,300," ""They're making it sound like he's dying,"" said Harry slowly."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,305,"  ""My brothers Crouch's personal assistant,"" Ron informed Sirius."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,307,"  ""Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,"" said Harry slowly, still reading the story."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,317,"  ""Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,"" said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,322,"  ""Right,"" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,324,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,327,"Then he said, ""Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?"""
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,337,"  ""It's possible,"" said Sirius."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,340," ""The elf wasn't the only one in that box,"" said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,342,"  ""Loads of people,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,352," ""No one,"" said Harry."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,357,"  ""I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,"" said Sirius, still pacing."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,359,"  ""He's okay,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,364,"  ""Says he's taken a liking to me,"" said Harry."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,365," ""Hmm,"" said Sirius, looking thoughtful."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,366," ""We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,"" Hermione told Sirius."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,375,"  ""Come off it,"" said Ron incredulously."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",85,377,"  ""It's more likely he did it than Winky,"" said Hermione stubbornly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,378," ""Told you,"" said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, ""told you she's obsessed with house -""  But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,380,"  ""Went to look in the bushes,"" said Harry, ""but there wasn't anyone else there."""
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",85,383,"  ""Yes,"" said Hermione in a heated voice, ""he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled -""  ""Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!"""
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,406," ""No, I'm not,"" said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,409," ""He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,"" said Sirius."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,421,"  ""That's what my dad said at the World Cup,"" said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,461," ""Yep,"" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,471," ""No idea,"" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,488," ""That's right,"" said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,504," ""No,"" said Sirius dully."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,508,"  ""He wasn't the only one,"" said Sirius bitterly."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,530," ""Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,"" Harry told Sirius."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,531," ""Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him,"" said Sirius, nodding."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,535," ""Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all,"" said Sirius."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,542," ""Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape -""  ""Oh give it a rest, Hermione,"" said Ron impatiently."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,547," ""I think they've both got a point,"" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,559,"  ""Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,"" said Ron."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,576," ""Well,"" said Sirius slowly, ""I wouldn't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,599,"  ""I can try,"" said Ron doubtfully."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,602,"  ""And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you're at it,"" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",85,603," ""Bagman told me they hadn't,"" said Harry."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,604," ""Yes, he's quoted in the article in there,"" said Sirius, nodding at the paper."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",85,617," ""It's half past three,"" said Hermione."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",85,634,"""I'll walk to the edge of the village with you,"" said Sirius, ""see if I can scrounge another paper."""
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",85,646,"  ""Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,"" said Hermione severely."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,647," ""I don't know,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",85,653," ""Poor old Snuffles,"" said Ron, breathing deeply."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,8," ""You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,14," ""Good idea,"" said Ron."
"dobby","goblet_of_fire",86,20," ""Winky is over there by the fire, miss,"" said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",86,21," ""Oh dear,"" said Hermione as she spotted Winky."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,36,"  ""Hey, Winky,"" said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, ""you don't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you?"
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,41,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""we haven't seen him since the first task."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",86,46," ""But we're not sure if that's true,"" said Hermione quickly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,111," ""Percy won't've had time to answer yet,"" said Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",86,113,"  ""No, it's not that,"" said Hermione."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,148," ""You'd better get up to the hospital wing,"" said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight."
"potter","goblet_of_fire",86,162,"Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, ""Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend?"
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,194,"  ""She had to go to the hospital wing,"" said Ron."
"pansy","goblet_of_fire",86,195," ""We'll explain later,"" Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",86,232,"  ""You missed a really good lesson,"" Harry told Hermione as they headed back toward the castle."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,239,"  ""No,"" said Ron shortly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,243," ""The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,270," ""It's rubbish,"" said Ron, still glaring down at his potato."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",86,274,"  ""Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,"" said Hermione brightly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",86,284," ""It'll die down, though,"" he told Hermione, ""if we just ignore it."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,300,"  ""Maybe she had you bugged,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",86,338," ""Yeah,"" said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,362,"  ""That wouldn't be too bad,"" said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,416,"  ""Yeah, all right,"" said Harry, slightly surprised."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,418,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry curiously."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,422,"  ""No, it's okay, Mr. Bagman,"" said Harry, suppressing a smile, ""I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks."""
"krum","goblet_of_fire",86,427," ""Don't vont to be overheard,"" said Krum shortly."
"krum","goblet_of_fire",86,436,"  ""Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,"" said Krum, looking suspiciously at Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,437," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""because were friends."""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,444,"  ""No,"" said Harry very firmly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,448,"  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,499,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, ""if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the-""  ""I've done ."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,521,"  ""Get up, Mr. Crouch,"" said Harry loudly and clearly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,527," ""I'm a student at the school,"" said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,531," ""No,"" said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,533,"  ""That's right,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,537,"  ""I'll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,"" said Harry."
"krum","goblet_of_fire",86,549,"""I'll get Dumbledore, I'll be quicker, I know where his office is -""  ""He is mad,"" said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,550," ""Just stay with him,"" said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,594," ""Just keep him here,"" said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",86,631,"Potter,"" said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,637," ""Look,"" said Harry angrily, ""Crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he says he wants to warn -""  The stone wall behind Snape slid open."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",86,662,"  ""Indeed,"" said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitch-darkness."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,671,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,674," ""Over here,"" said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",86,701,"  ""No,"" said Dumbledore swiftly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",86,719,"  ""Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",86,769," ""Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,"" said Dumbledore sharply."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",86,780,"  ""Er - yes,"" said Harry, staring at him."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",87,1,"   It comes down to this,"" said Hermione, rubbing her forehead."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,3,"  ""It must've been Crouch,"" said Ron at once."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,6,"  ""I don't think so,"" said Harry, shaking his head."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,13,"hows this for a theory,"" said Ron excitedly."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",87,24," ""Just go through it again, Harry,"" said Hermione."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,26,"  ""I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",87,34,"  ""Well, that was his fault,"" said Hermione testily."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,35," ""He was out of his mind,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,47,"  ""He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,"" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,63,"  ""Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",87,65," ""We need to see Professor Moody,"" said Hermione."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,66,"""We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch,""  ""If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,67," ""Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,"" said Ron, ""because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -""  ""Shh!"""
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,78," ""Sending a letter,"" said Harry and George in unison."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,92," ""Didn't sound like that,"" said Ron."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,95,"Can't see why you would, but -""  ""It's my business if you're blackmailing someone,"" said Ron."
"george","goblet_of_fire",87,97,"  ""Told you, I was joking,"" said George."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,112,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,121,"said Ron slowly, ""I dunno if they would."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,128,"  ""It's this joke shop idea they've got,"" said Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",87,142,"  ""Yes, but this is the law"" said Hermione, looking scared."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,162," ""Yes,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",87,198," ""Well, he wasn't invisible,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",87,202,"said Hermione eagerly, ""or because someone made him?"""
"ron","goblet_of_fire",87,206," ""So,"" said Ron, ""d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?"""
"ha","goblet_of_fire",87,239,"She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, ""Ha!"

"professor","goblet_of_fire",87,322," ""My dears,"" said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, ""we have almost finished our work on planetary divination."

"harry","goblet_of_fire",88,617,"  ""Yes, Professor,"" said Harry, turning to go."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,10,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,34," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""but he's only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage."""
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",89,37,"""Mind you, she's definitely got giant blood, and she doesn't want to admit it-""  ""Of course she doesn't,"" said Hermione sharply, looking up."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",89,75,"  ""Good training for when we're all Aurors,"" said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",89,88,"  ""Come and look at this,"" said Ron, who was standing by the window."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,95," ""He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie,"" said Harry curiously."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",89,96," ""He can't be,"" said Hermione, ""I've told you, those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",89,113,"""Nothing,"" said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",89,120,"  ""No,"" said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",89,123," ""No,"" said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,161,"""There's no way she was there, there's no way she could've heard -""  ""The window was open,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",89,179," ""Yes,"" said Hermione breathlessly."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",89,218," ""Dunno,"" said Ron."
"bill","goblet_of_fire",89,254," ""It's great being back here,"" said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady's friend, winked at him from her frame)."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,258,"  ""Oh yeah,"" said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,269," ""Yeah, okay,"" said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the Great Hall."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",89,276," ""Ignore him,"" said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father."
"bill","goblet_of_fire",89,292," ""Not good,"" said Bill."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",89,310,"okay,"" said Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",89,317," ""Hello,"" said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley's face."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,337,"  ""I'm okay,"" said Harry."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",89,347," ""We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,"" said Professor McGonagall to the champions."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",89,532," ""So did I,"" said Cedric."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",89,535," ""Yeah,"" said Cedric."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,537,"  ""I don't know,"" said Harry slowly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,540," ""No,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,640," ""'The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,'"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,725," ""Stop being noble,"" said Harry irritably."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",89,732,"  ""I had help on the egg in the first place,"" said Cedric."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,733," ""We're still square,"" said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",89,734," ""You should've got more points on the second task,"" said Cedric mulishly."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",89,740,"  ""No,"" said Cedric."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",89,760,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",90,14," ""Nope,"" said Harry."
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",90,18,"  ""I dunno,"" said Cedric."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",90,21,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,19,"  ""Hold out your arm,"" said Voldemort lazily."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,105," ""Welcome, Death Eaters,"" said Voldemort quietly."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,123," ""And I answer myself,"" whispered Voldemort, ""they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,167," ""Get up, Avery,"" said Voldemort softly."
"wormtail","goblet_of_fire",91,179,"  ""Yes, Master,"" moaned Wormtail, ""please."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,184,"  ""Yet you helped return me to my body,"" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,203," ""May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,"" said Voldemort."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,240," ""The Lestranges should stand here,"" said Voldemort quietly."
"macnair","goblet_of_fire",91,265,"thank you,"" murmured Macnair."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,274,"  ""The same goes for you, Nott,"" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure  in Mr. Goyles shadow."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,275," ""My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful -""  ""That will do,"" said Voldemort."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,293," ""Yes,"" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,309,"  ""Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,"" said Voldemort."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",91,499," ""You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,"" said Voldemort."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",92,26,"Harry,"" said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",92,46," ""Very good,"" said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",92,62," ""A little break,"" said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, ""a little pause ."
"voldemort","goblet_of_fire",92,77," ""I asked you whether you want me to do that again,"" said Voldemort softly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",92,352,"  ""I will,"" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",93,99,"  ""Dumbledore said stay,"" said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",93,114," ""Cup was a Portkey,"" said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",93,198,"  ""He took stuff from his father's grave, and from Wormtail, and me,"" said Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",93,203," ""Blood,"" said Harry, raising his arm."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",93,208,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,216,"He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway -  ""There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts!"
"cedric","goblet_of_fire",93,302,"""Cedric gave me the clue -""  ""Who told Cedric to open it underwater?"
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,402,"  ""No,"" said Dumbledore sharply."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,403," ""Dumbledore, he ought to - look at him - he's been through enough tonight -""  ""He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,"" said Dumbledore curtly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,408,"  ""This is not Alastor Moody,"" said Dumbledore quietly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,438," ""Polyjuice Potion, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",93,477,"  ""Good heavens,"" said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,485,"  ""He is simply Stunned, Winky,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,500," ""I would like you to tell us,"" said Dumbledore softly, ""how you came to be here."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,571,"  ""Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,605," ""So you took the wand,"" said Dumbledore, ""and what did you do with it?"""
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,686,"But first -""  ""You needed Alastor Moody,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",93,712,"  ""But your father escaped,"" said Dumbledore."
"professor","goblet_of_fire",94,6,"  ""Of course,"" said Professor McGonagall."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,40,"  ""They are with Professor Sprout,"" said Dumbledore."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",94,59," ""'Lo, Fawkes,"" said Harry quietly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,69,"Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,94," ""He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,"" Harry told Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,123," ""Exactly,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,129," ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,133," ""They will not work properly against each other,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,145," ""Which means,"" said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry's face, ""that some form of Cedric must have reappeared."""
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,149," ""No spell can reawaken the dead,"" said Dumbledore heavily."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,161,"  ""An echo,"" said Dumbledore, ""which retained Cedric's appearance and character."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",94,173," ""Yes,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,175," ""The last murders the wand performed,"" said Dumbledore, nodding."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,191," ""I will say it again,"" said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,222,"  ""This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,"" said Dumbledore simply."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,227," ""I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",94,282,"There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.-""  When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight's events,"" said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,297,"  ""But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,318,"  ""As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,"" said Dumbledore, ""we heard Barty Crouch confess."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,327,"  ""When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,""  said Dumbledore steadily."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,335," ""Certainly, I believe Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,360,"  ""Listen to me, Cornelius,"" said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,413,"  ""Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,"" said Dumbledore, ""or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!"""
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,416,"""If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants -people hate them, Dumbledore - end of my career -""  ""You are blinded,"" said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, ""by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius!"
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,430," ""If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,"" said Dumbledore, ""we have reached a parting of the ways."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,439,"But if you're going to work against me -""  ""The only one against whom I intend to work,"" said Dumbledore, ""is Lord Voldemort."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",94,446," ""There,"" said Snape harshly."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,483,"  ""Then I need to send a message to Arthur,"" said Dumbledore."
"bill","goblet_of_fire",94,485,"  ""I'll go to Dad,"" said Bill, standing up."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,487,"  ""Excellent,"" said Dumbledore."
"bill","goblet_of_fire",94,491,"If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry -""  ""Leave it to me,"" said Bill."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,493," ""Minerva,"" said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, ""I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,515,"  ""He is here at my invitation,"" said Dumbledore, looking between them, ""as are you, Severus."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,520," ""I will settle, in the short term,"" said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, ""for a lack of open hostility."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,526," ""That will do to be going on with,"" said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",94,532,"  ""But -"" said Harry."
"sirius","goblet_of_fire",94,536,"Harry,"" said Sirius, turning to him."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",94,539,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,546," ""Severus,"" said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, ""you know what I must ask you to do."
"snape","goblet_of_fire",94,551,"  ""I am,"" said Snape."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",94,553," ""Then good luck,"" said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",94,570,"  ""I don't want that gold,"" said Harry in an expressionless voice."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",94,580," ""I told him to take the cup with me,"" said Harry."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",95,35," ""She said Dumbledore's got his reasons,"" said Ron, shaking his head darkly."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",95,58,"he said gruffly ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",95,136," ""The end,"" said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, ""of another year."""
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",95,139," ""There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,"" said Dumbledore, ""but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,"" he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, ""enjoying our feast with us."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",95,166," ""Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","goblet_of_fire",95,179," ""Every guest in this Hall,"" said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, ""will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come."
"fleur","goblet_of_fire",95,202," ""We will see each uzzer again, I 'ope,"" said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand."

"fleur","goblet_of_fire",95,206," ""Good-bye, 'Arry,"" said Fleur, turning to go."
"ron","goblet_of_fire",95,209," Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,"" said Ron."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",95,220,"all right,"" said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight."
"krum","goblet_of_fire",95,227," ""I liked Diggory,"" said Krum abruptly to Harry."
"harry","goblet_of_fire",95,254,"  ""He'll never keep Rita quiet,"" said Harry."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",95,256,"  ""Oh, Rita hasn't written anything at all since the third task,"" said Hermione in an oddly constrained voice."

"hermione","goblet_of_fire",95,285," ""No, I'm not,"" said Hermione, beaming."
"hermione","goblet_of_fire",95,291,"  ""Exactly,"" said Hermione."

"draco","goblet_of_fire",95,309,"Granger,"" said Draco Malfoy."
"malfoy","goblet_of_fire",95,312," ""So,"" said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips."

"george","goblet_of_fire",95,356,"  ""Oh,"" said George darkly."

"fred","goblet_of_fire",95,377,"  ""So,"" said Fred impatiently, ""it vanished, didn't it?"
"fred","goblet_of_fire",95,387,"  ""In the end, he turned pretty nasty,"" said Fred."
"george","goblet_of_fire",95,389,"  ""So we asked for our money back,"" said George glowering."
"fred","goblet_of_fire",95,392," ""Right in one,"" said Fred."

"professor","half_blood_prince",153,72,"   ""My dear Sybill,"" said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, ""there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said ""   ""Very well,"" said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,78,"  ""Please close the door and sit down, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,82,"  ""No,"" said Dumbledore, ""Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself."
"harry","half_blood_prince",153,89,"   ""Ah,"" said Harry, brought up short."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,93,"  ""I see,"" said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed."
"professor","half_blood_prince",153,118,"When he could stand it no longer he said, ""Professor Dumbledore, I'm really sorry."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,122,"   ""Thank you for saying that, Harry,"" said Dumbledore quietly."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,126,"  ""Then we shall say no more about it just now,"" said Dumbledore more kindly, ""but continue with our story where we left off."
"harry","half_blood_prince",153,128,"   ""Yes, sir,"" said Harry quickly."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,132,"  ""Very good,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,137,"  ""But now, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, ""now things become murkier and stranger."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,162,"  ""I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,176,"""Deeply uneasy,"" said Dumbledore."
"harry","half_blood_prince",153,188,"   ""I'll bet he was,"" said Harry, unable to contain himself."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,189,"  ""Well, quite,"" said Dumbledore, with a faint smile."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,232,"  ""Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,"" said Voldemort."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,235,"  ""I am ordered here because of them,"" said Voldemort quietly."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,244,"   ""I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,"" said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,270,"""A badger,"" murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,315,"   ""Oh yes,"" said Voldemort quietly."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,322,"   ""Time to leave, Harry,"" said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore's office."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,323,"  ""Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,"" said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,327,"  ""I see we are of one mind,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,330,"   ""She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,332,"""Yes, that is my conclusion too,"" said Dumbledore."
"harry","half_blood_prince",153,333,"""And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey ""   "" because she was a house-elf,"" said Harry."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,334,"He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. ""Precisely,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,342,"  ""Now,"" said Dumbledore, ""if you don't mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story."
"harry","half_blood_prince",153,347,"   ""But,"" said Harry, frowning, ""it seems mad."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,354,"   ""Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,"" said Dumbledore."
"harry","half_blood_prince",153,356,"""The locket maybe,"" said Harry, ""but why take the cup as well?"""
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,357,"   ""It had belonged to another of Hogwartss founders,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,370,"""Mine,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,382,"  ""Good evening, Tom,"" said Dumbledore easily."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,384,"   ""Thank you,"" said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured  the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,387,"   ""I am glad you approve,"" said Dumbledore, smiling."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,389,"   ""That would be welcome,"" said Voldemort."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,398,"""These days, 1 am known as ""   ""I know what you are known as,"" said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,404,"  ""I am surprised you have remained here so long,"" said Voldemort after a short pause."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,406,"   ""Well,"" said Dumbledore, still smiling, ""to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,408,"   ""I see it still,"" said Voldemort."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,409,"""I merely wondered why you  who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister ""   ""Three times at the last count, actually,"" said Dumbledore."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,429,"  ""Certainly,"" said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,443,"   ""Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,"" suggested Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,455,"   ""I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,"" said Dumbledore."
"voldemort","half_blood_prince",153,457,"   ""You are mistaken,"" said Voldemort."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,462,"   ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,"" said Dumbledore lightly."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,476,"""If you do not want to give me a job ""   ""Of course I don't,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,482,"   ""It is,"" said Dumbledore, also standing."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,484,"   ""No, nothing,"" said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,498,"   ""I have ideas,"" said Dumbledore, ""but no more than that."""
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,500,"   ""I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,"" said Dumbledore."
"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",153,507,"   ""Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,"" said Dumbledore."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,2,"  ""You won't find anything in there,"" said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening."
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,3,"  ""Don't start, Hermione,"" said Harry."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,5,"   ""He would if you'd just listened to Snape in our first year,"" said Hermione dismissively."
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,23,"""There's only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that's the Imperius Curse, which is illegal ""   ""Yeah, I know that, thanks,"" said Harry, not looking up from the book."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,29,"   ""You're going about it the wrong way,"" said Hermione."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,34,"""It can't be B  U  M ""   ""No, it isn't,"" said Hermione, pulling Ron's essay toward her."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,38,"   ""Yes, it must,"" said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, ""because we were asked how we'd deal with dementors, not 'Dug-bogs', and I don't remember you changing your name to 'Roonil Wazlib either."""
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,42,"   ""It's okay, we can fix it,"" said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand."
"ron","half_blood_prince",154,43," ""I love you, Hermione,"" said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-bing his eyes wearily."
"ron","half_blood_prince",154,45,"   ""1 won't,"" said Ron into his hands."
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,51,"""You and Cho just ""  ""Sort of fell apart, yeah,"" said Harry."
"ron","half_blood_prince",154,52," ""Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,"" said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his mis-spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,55,"   ""There,"" said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron's essay."
"ron","half_blood_prince",154,56,"  ""Thanks a million,"" said Ron."
"kreacher","half_blood_prince",154,61,"  Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, ""Kreacher!"""
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,81,"But surely, Harry, you didn't tell him not to ""  ""No, of course I didn't,"" said Harry quickly."
"kreacher","half_blood_prince",154,94,"   ""Yeah, we don't need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,"" Harry told Kreacher."

"dobby","half_blood_prince",154,98,"   ""Harry Potter, sir,"" squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, ""the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection."
"ron","half_blood_prince",154,105,"   ""Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,"" said Ron."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,106,"  ""I think it'll be part of the magic of the room,"" said Hermione."
"dobby","half_blood_prince",154,110," ""No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,"" said Dobby."
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,111,"  ""No, it's not,"" said Harry at once."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,113,"   ""But I don't think you will, Harry,"" said Hermione slowly."
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,117,"   ""There'll be a way around that,"" said Harry dismissively."
"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,119,"  ""Kreachers done well too,"" said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, ""The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear ""   ""Get out of it,"" Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated."
"ron","half_blood_prince",154,127,"  ""Yeah, it's great,"" said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost com-pleted essay."
"harry","half_blood_prince",154,132,"You wouldn't think he'd trust lots of them to know what he's do-ing---""   ""Yeah, that is weird,"" said Harry, frowning."

"harry","half_blood_prince",154,213,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry aloud."
"snape","half_blood_prince",154,233,"  ""Late again, Potter,"" said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom."
"snape","half_blood_prince",154,237,"  ""Before we start, I want your dementor essays,"" said Snape, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk."
"seamus","half_blood_prince",154,240,"   ""Sir,"" said Seamus, ""I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost?"
"snape","half_blood_prince",154,241,"Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius ""   ""No, there wasn't,"" said Snape in a bored voice."

"snape","half_blood_prince",154,254,"So they'd be solid ""   ""A five-year-old could have told us as much,"" sneered Snape."
"snape","half_blood_prince",154,262,"  ""Another ten points from Gryffindor,"" said Snape."
"snape","half_blood_prince",154,267,"""Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,"" said Snape, smirking a little, ""and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse."""

"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,312,"  ""You'd do better,"" said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, ""to go straight to Slughorn's of-fice and try and get that memory from him."""

"tonks","half_blood_prince",154,357,"""That lit-tle kid trying to kill his ""   ""The Prophet's often behind the times,"" said Tonks, who didn't seem to be listening to him."

"harry","half_blood_prince",154,396,"   ""I dunno,"" said Harry, shrugging, ""but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now."

"hermione","half_blood_prince",154,407,"   ""And yet,"" said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, ""I doubt you'd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn't laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia."""

"dumbledore","half_blood_prince",159,164,"""Aha,"" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back."

"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",49,231," ""Of course I did,"" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",49,245," ""No,"" said Ron flatly."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,14," ""We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's,"" said Ron dismissively."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,36," ""He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once you'd yelled and woken people up,"" said Harry thoughtfully."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,67," ""Oh,"" said Ron, looking slightly put out."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,158,"  ""Hi, Neville,"" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,174," ""We're not -- meeting here,"" said Harry."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,206," ""Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,"" said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,264,"If Malfoy tells anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --"" ""See you later,"" said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,279," ""Come with me, Potter,"" said Snape."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,284," ""Sit,"" said Snape."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,287," ""Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,"" said Snape."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,300,"  ""No,"" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,304," ""Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,"" said Harry."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,309,"  ""I know that,"" said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,310,"""It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --""  ""Malfoy is not having hallucinations,"" snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot apart."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,312,"  ""I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,"" said Harry."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,329,"  ""My dad didn't strut,"" said Harry, before he could stop himself."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,364," ""Ron gave them to me,"" said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,425," ""I certainly did,"" said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,456,"  ""No,"" said Harry quickly."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,474," ""Professor, I --""  ""I don't want to hear explanations,"" said Lupin shortly."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,498," ""It's my fault,"" said Ron abruptly."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",50,506,"  ""No,"" said Hermione."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,9," Hagrid  ""They can't do this,"" said Harry."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,12,"  ""Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,"" said Hermione, wiping her eyes."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,18,"  ""Yeah, it will,"" said Ron fiercely."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,27," ""Oh -- well -- he was old,"" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,68,"  ""We're due in Charms,"" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,78," ""That's weird,"" said Harry, staring at Ron."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,81," ""She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,"" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,94,"  ""Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,"" said Harry."
"professor","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,128," ""I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,"" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,148," ""Yeah, there's a burn on this table,"" said Ron, pointing."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",51,229," ""So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,"" Wood told Harry constantly."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,19," ""No,"" said Hermione shortly."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,21,"  ""Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,"" said Ron, but very quietly."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,53,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,90," ""Nope,"" said Ron in an offhand voice."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,99," ""That's convenient,"" snorted Ron."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,101,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, looking at his own watch."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,105," ""She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,"" she informed Harry and Ron."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,116," ""Rubbish,"" said Ron."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,119,"  ""Meet you in the common room,"" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's voice called, ""Harry Potter!"""
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,131," ""Er --"" said Harry, ""a dark shape..."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,144,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry firmly."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,206," ""Buckbeak lost,"" said Ron weakly."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,214," Hagrid  ""We've got to go,"" said Harry at once."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,216,"  ""Sunset, though,"" said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,226," ""That's true,"" said Hermione, getting to her feet."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,229,"  ""You -- you tap it and say, 'Dissendium,'"" said Harry."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",52,264," ""I'll do it, Hagrid,"" said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,7," ""We can't,"" said Ron, who was paper-white."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,13,"  ""Come on,"" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,72,"  ""He's friends with that dog,"" said Harry grimly."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,80," ""This way,"" said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,178,"roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned -  ""Get out of the way!"""
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,189," ""You killed my parents,"" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,200,"  ""I understand a lot better than you think,"" said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,274,"  ""You're wrong,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,292,"  ""He'll be delighted,"" said Lupin coolly."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,301,"  ""But they already know,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,306,"  ""Some of the staff thought so,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,313," I have not been helping Sirius,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,316," There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt ""You're armed, we're not."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,321,"  ""The map,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,325," ""Of course I know how to work it,"" said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,333,"  ""The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,"" said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,341,"  I couldn't believe my eyes,"" said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry's interruption."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,349," ""No, Ron,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,357,"  ""Everything,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",53,368," ""What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --""  ""No, he's not,"" said Lupin quietly."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,28,"  ""You're nutters, both of you,"" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,41," ""Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,"" said Lupin, nodding."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,68,"but you'll need to help me, Sirius,"" said Lupin, I only know how it began..."""
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,77," ""It's not,"" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,125," ""Yes, indeed,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,133," ""They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,156,"  ""A thought that still haunts me,"" said Lupin heavily."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,178,"  ""He's here, Sirius,"" said Lupin heavily."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",54,199,"  ""So that's why Snape doesn't like you,"" said Harry slowly, ""because he thought you were in on the joke?"""
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,4," ""I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,"" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,18,"Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --""  ""Severus, you're making a mistake,"" said Lupin urgently."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,19,"""You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --""  ""Two more for Azkaban tonight,"" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,22,"a tame werewolf --""  ""You fool,"" said Lupin softly."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,61," ""Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,"" snarled Snape."
"snape","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,65,"  ""Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,"" hissed Snape."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,97," ""I'm still not saying I believe you,"" he told Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,98," ""Then it's time we offered you some proof,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,106,"  ""You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,"" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,119," ""My God,"" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,135,"He's been in my family for ages, right --""  ""Twelve years, in fact,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,174,"  ""No,"" said Lupin, ""Harry-""  ""And now you've come to finish him off!"""
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,178," ""Harry,"" said Lupin hurriedly, ""don't you see?"
"lily","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,188,"""I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me...."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,200," ""Enough of this,"" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,205," ""Force him to show himself,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,216," ""I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,229," ""Well, hello, Peter,"" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,241,"  ""So we've heard,"" said Lupin, more coldly."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,247," ""No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things out,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,283,"""You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --""  ""I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,"" said Lupin evenly."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,309,"  ""Certainly, Hermione,"" said Lupin courteously."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,398,"  ""Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,402," ""Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,"" said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,407,"  ""Yes, I think so,"" said Lupin grimly."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,474," ""You should have realized,"" said Lupin quietly, ""if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,506," ""Very well,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,509," ""I'm going to tie him up,"" said Lupin."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,516," ""Right,"" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,525," ""There's nothing seriously wrong with him,"" said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,536,"  ""I'll do it,"" said Lupin."
"ron","prisoner_of_azkaban",55,537," ""And me,"" said Ron savagely, limping forward."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",56,14,"  ""You' re free,"" said Harry."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",56,17,"  ""Yeah, I knew that,"" said Harry."
"lupin","prisoner_of_azkaban",56,61," ""One wrong move, Peter,"" said Lupin threateningly ahead."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",56,117," ""We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone,"" said Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight."
"dumbledore","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,114,"Headmaster, I must insist --""  ""My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger,"" said Dumbledore calmly."
"dumbledore","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,117,"""Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --""  ""That, indeed, is Black's story,"" said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles."
"dumbledore","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,124,"  ""Now, Snape,"" said Fudge, startled, ""the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances --""  ""I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,"" said Dumbledore abruptly."
"dumbledore","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,128,"""They need treatment, they need rest --""  ""This cannot wait,"" said Dumbledore."

"dumbledore","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,168," ""What we need,"" said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, ""is more time."""

"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,222,"  ""Yes,"" said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,243,"  ""This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,"" said Hermione."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,266," ""We'll run for it,"" said Harry determinedly."

"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,304," ""Hermione,"" said Harry suddenly, ""what if we -- we just run in there and grab Pettigrew --""  ""No!"""
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,312," ""I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,"" said Harry, ""or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --""  ""Exactly!"
"dumbledore","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,403,"  ""How extraordinary,"" said Dumbledore."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,431," ""We'll have to hide in here,"" said Hermione, who looked very shaken."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,438," ""We're going to have to move,"" said Harry, thinking hard."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,440,"  ""Okay,"" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope."
"hermione","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,458," ""That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,"" said Hermione."
"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,468,"  ""Macnair and Fudge would've come too,"" said Harry bitterly."

"harry","prisoner_of_azkaban",57,754,"said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff  ""Get on -- there's not much time,"" said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady."
