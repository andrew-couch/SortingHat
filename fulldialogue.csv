"If some far-fetched story appears, they say something like, ""A tale worthy of Harry Potter"", and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it's, ""Let's hope he hasn't got a scar on his forehead or we'll be asked to worship him next"" - '  'I don't want anyone to worship - ' Harry began hotly.","order_of_the_phoenix",99,356

"  'No, it's been lousy,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,81
"said Harry incredulously.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,85
"  There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the Headmaster.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,99
" 'Oh yeah,' said Sirius sarcastically.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,102
" Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,' said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,108

"  'He's feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,' said Bill, 'he hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know - '  A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,158

"  'Personally,' said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, 'I think it better that Harry gets the facts - 'not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture - from us, rather than a garbled version from .","order_of_the_phoenix",100,253
"I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry's best interests at heart -'  'He's not your son,' said Sirius quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,262
" 'Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,' said Lupin sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,268

"  'More than he thinks we do, anyway,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,321
" 'Because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,325
"  'Or rather, you messed it up for him,' said Lupin, with a satisfied smile.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,329
"said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,333
"  'And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,336
"said Bill incredulously.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,341
"  Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,343

" 'Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can't carry out his plans,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,346
" 'Dumbledore's got a shrewd idea,' said Lupin, 'and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.'","order_of_the_phoenix",100,349

"  'We're doing our best,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,356
"  'Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,' said Bill.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,358
"  'Because of the Ministry's attitude,' said Tonks.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,361

"  'Fudge is frightened of him, you see,' said Tonks sadly.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,370
"said Harry incredulously.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,372
"  'Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,379
"said Harry angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,383
"  'Because accepting that Voldermort's back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn't had to cope with for nearly fourteen yea 's,' said Sirius bitterly.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,385

" 'And I'm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,397
"  'Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,' said Sirius, 'and it's very important  for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.'","order_of_the_phoenix",100,399
"said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,404
" They're trying to discredit him,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",100,408

" 'Could be anything,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,57
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,59
"  'Maybe it's something that can kill loads of people at once,' suggested George.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,61
" 'Maybe it's some particularly painful way of killing people,' said Ron learfully.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,62
" 'He's got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,' said Harry, 'he doesn't need anything more efficient than that.'","order_of_the_phoenix",101,63

" 'Well, Molly, I'm pretty sure this is a Boggart,' said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, 'but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out - knowing my mother, it could be something much worse.'","order_of_the_phoenix",101,124
" They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,126

"That's what we're putting in the adverts, anyway,' whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs Weasley's line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray Doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,167
"  'Us,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,171

" 'Well, we haven't had a chance to get premises yet,' said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack, 'so we're running it as a mail-order service at the moment.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,176

"  'Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,' said the elf, then muttered very fast, 'Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it - '  'I thought it might be that,' said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall.","order_of_the_phoenix",101,286

"  The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,' said Dumbledore.","order_of_the_phoenix",103,288
" 'And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,' said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.","order_of_the_phoenix",103,293
"  'But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school, Harry's behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing,' said Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.","order_of_the_phoenix",103,295
"  The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,' said Dumbledore.","order_of_the_phoenix",103,300
" 'Of course they can,' said Dumbledore, inclining his head.","order_of_the_phoenix",103,303
"  'Excellent,' said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feel, pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish.","order_of_the_phoenix",103,342
"  'I think so,' said Harry quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,16
"Patronus Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,40
" 'Yeah,' said Harry, 'yeah, I'm good at escaping.'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,50
" 'I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,' said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,64
" 'Mr Weasley,' said Harry slowly, 'if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he's seeing them alone, how do we know they haven't put the Imperius Curse on him?'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,97
"yelled Ron, punching the air.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,112
"  'They were bound to clear you,' said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes, 'there was no case against you, none at all.'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,114
"  'Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering you all knew I'd get off,' said Harry, smiling.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,115
"said Sirius sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,123
"  'Absolutely,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,130
" 'Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,' said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to everyone's plates.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,141
" 'Yeah, he swung it for me,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,142
"said Hermione, looking alarmed.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,147
"said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,165
"  'That's a bit harsh, Hermione,' said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger, 'you wouldn't want to be stuck inside this house without any company.'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,168
"said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,170
"  'I don't think that's true,' said Harry, wringing out his cloth.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,173
"  'He just didn't want to get his own hopes up even more,' said Hermione wisely.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,175
"said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,179
"said Harry heatedly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,183
" 'No, I just think he's been very lonely for a long time,' said Hermione simply.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,184
"said Ron bitterly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,189
"said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs Weasley left them to it.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,194
" 'We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally  'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,211
" 'And about time too,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,212
" Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, 'and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,215
"said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,217
" 'One sacked, one dead, one's memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,' said Harry, counting them off on his fingers.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,218
"said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,226
" 'No way,' said George in a hushed voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,233
" 'There's been a mistake,' said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,234
"said Fred, in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,238
"said George indignantly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,240
"said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,242
" 'I suppose all the mad stuff must've counted against him,' said George to Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,243
" 'Yeah,' said Fred slowly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,244
"  'Ohh, Mum's going to be revolting,' groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,252
"  'No,' said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,265
"said Hermione, her jaw dropping.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,270
"said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,280
"That's really - '  'Unexpected,' said George, nodding.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,289
" 'No,' said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, 'no it's not .","order_of_the_phoenix",104,290
"  'Get him red and gold to match his badge,' said George, smirking.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,306
" 'His badge,' said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,309
"said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,329
"said Ron, looking as though he did not dare believe his ears.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,346
"  'We've already bought him some,' said Fred sourly, who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,350
" 'Or a new cauldron, Charlie's old one's rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers -  'Mum,' said Ron hopefully, 'can I have a new broom?'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,351
"said Fred in a falsely anxious voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,376
" 'We could curtsey, if you like,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,377
" 'Oh, shut up,' said Ron, scowling at them.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,378
"said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,380
"  'I'd love to see him try' sniggered George.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,382
"said Hermione angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,384
"  'We're going to have to watch our step, George,' said Fred, pretending to tremble, 'with these two on our case .","order_of_the_phoenix",104,386
"said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,392
"  'I don't think they are,' said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,394
"said Hermione tentatively.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,412
" 'Well done, Hermione,' said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, 'brilliant.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,413
"  'Thanks,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,416
"  'Yeah, no problem,' said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,419
"  He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,421
" 'Yeah,' said Ron, 'yeah, I suppose .","order_of_the_phoenix",104,490
" 'I thought we'd have a little party not a sit-down dinner,' she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny as they entered the room.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,501
" 'I was never a prefect myself,' said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,545
"said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,549
" 'Like the ability to behave myself,' said Tonks.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,550
" Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,551
"  'I think Dumbledore might have hoped I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,557
"  Oh - I dunno - ' said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,578
"  'Look what Dung's got us,' said George, holding out his hand to Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,581
" 'Venomous Tentacula seeds,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,584
"said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,587
" 'Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of Knarl quills,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,592
"said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,595
"said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins' outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,602
"said Kingsley.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,616
" 'He'll have had his reasons,' replied Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,617
" 'Yeah,' said Harry, once again attempting to grin.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,713
"shouted Harry, staring down at his own dead body on the floor.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,783
" 'Molly' said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,793
"  'Don't be stupid,' said Harry, trying to smile.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,824
"  'Molly, that's enough,' said Lupin firmly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,834
" 'Don't worry about Percy,' said Sirius abruptly.","order_of_the_phoenix",104,844
" 'And as for who's going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,' said Lupin, smiling slightly, 'what do you think we'd do, let them starve?'","order_of_the_phoenix",104,848
" 'Mrs Weasley's patched her up,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,20
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,23
"said Harry irritably.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,27
"  'I don't know, it's just what Mad-Eye says,' said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch, 'but if we don't leave soon we're definitely going to miss the train .","order_of_the_phoenix",105,29
" Thanks, Lee,' said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,87
" 'Nothing,' said Lupin.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,99
"  'Well, look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,102
"  'It's been great meeting all of you,' said Tonks, hugging Hermione and Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,109
" 'He shouldn't have come with us,' said Hermione in a worried voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,128
" 'Oh, lighten up,' said Ron, 'he hasn't seen daylight for months, poor bloke.'","order_of_the_phoenix",105,129
"  'Well,' said Fred, clapping his hands together, 'can't stand around chatting all day, we've got business to discuss with Lee.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,130
" 'Er,' said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,136
" 'Oh,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,139
"  'I don't think we'll have to stay there all journey,' said Hermione quickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,142
"  'Fine,' said Harry again.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,144
"  'Yeah, definitely,' said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,146
" 'I know you're not,' said Harry and he grinned.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,148
"  'Right,' said Harry, picking up Hedwig's cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,152
"said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,169
" 'Don't be silly,' said Ginny, laughing, 'she's all right.'","order_of_the_phoenix",105,171
"said Ginny, 'is it OK if we take these seats?'","order_of_the_phoenix",105,175
" Thanks,' said Ginny, smiling at her.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,183
" 'Yes,' said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,190
" 'I know I am,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,193
"  'I'm nobody,' said Neville hurriedly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,197
" 'No you're not,' said Ginny sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,198
"  'Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,' said Luna in a singsong voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,201
"said Neville.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,208
"said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Neville's grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,210
" 'No,' said Neville.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,211
" 'It's really, really rare,' said Neville, beaming.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,222
"said Neville proudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,231
"hi,' said Harry blankly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,265
"said Cho.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,269
" 'Never mind,' said Ginny bracingly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,280
"said Neville again, in a small voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,286
" 'I'm starving,' said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,289
" 'Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,' said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,291
"said Ron, still with his eyes closed.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,294
" 'Malfoy,' replied Harry at once, certain his worst fear would be confirmed.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,295
" 'Course,' said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,296
" 'And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,' said Hermione viciously.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,297
" 'Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,' said Ron thickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,303
" 'And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,304
" 'We're supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,' he told Harry and Neville, 'and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,315
"said Hermione sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,320
" 'Yeah, right, because Malfoy won't abuse it at all,' said Ron sarcastically.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,321
"  'For heavens sake, Ron - '  'I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing,' said Ron happily.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,324
"said Ron, frowning at her.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,355
"'Cornelius ""Goblin-Crusher"" Fudge, that's what his friends call him.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,399
" 'Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,411
"  'Excuse me,' said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,413
"  'I - oh,' said Hermione, looking embarrassed.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,415
"I mean, it's quite  'I'll have it back, thank you,' said Luna coldly, and leaning forwards she snatched it out of Harry's hands.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,422
"  'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.'","order_of_the_phoenix",105,429
" 'Shut up, Malfoy,' said Hermione sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,434
" 'I seem to have touched a nerve,' said Malfoy, smirking.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,435
"said Hermione, standing up.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,438
" 'Chuck us another Frog,' said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,441
"What if Mr Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco?","order_of_the_phoenix",105,451
" 'We'd better change,' said Hermione at last, and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,458
" 'I'll carry that owl, if you like,' said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,463
" 'Oh - er - thanks,' said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig's more securely into his arms.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,464
" 'I don't know,' said Ginny, 'but we'd better get out of the way, we're blocking the door.'","order_of_the_phoenix",105,480
" That Luna girl was carrying him,' said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,504
"I dunno,' said Ron, sounding worried.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,506
"  'Ginny's got him,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,517
"  Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks,  Thanks,' said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,521
"he's all right,' said Ron gruffly.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,540
"said Harry impatiently.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,549
"said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,578
" 'Yeah,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,579
"said Harry desperately, turning to Luna.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,587
" 'Oh, yes,' said Luna, 'I've been able to see them ever since my first day here.","order_of_the_phoenix",105,589
"  'I'll be quite glad if he has,' said Luna, 'he isn't a very good teacher, is he?'","order_of_the_phoenix",106,7
"said Harry, Ron and Ginny angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,9
"  'Well, we in Ravenclaw think he's a bit of a joke,' said Luna, unfazed.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,18
"said Ron beside him.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,31
"yeah,' said Harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,35
" 'He can't have left,' said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,45
" 'Of course he hasn't,' said Harry firmly.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,46
"said Hermione uneasily.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,51
" 'No,' said Harry at once.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,52
"yeah, that'll be it,' said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid's absence.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,59
"said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,69
"  'Nice cardigan,' said Ron, smirking.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,71
"said Ron, his eyebrows raised.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,113
" Too right it has,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,114
"said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,118
" 'To our newcomers,' said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, 'welcome!","order_of_the_phoenix",106,133
" 'Excellent,' said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,138
"  'Oh, yes,' said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,142
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,146
"said Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,154
"  'Well, now, you shouldn't take that attitude,' said Nick reprovingly.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,156
"  'Only because you're terrified of him,' said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,160
"said Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,172
"said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his food.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,176
"  'Oh, forget it,' said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,178
" 'Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,' said Dumbledore.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,186
"No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,197
"  'Yes, it certainly was illuminating,' said Hermione in a low voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,246
"  'I said illuminating, not enjoyable,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,250
"said Harry in surprise.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,253
"  There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,' said Hermione grimly.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,255
"said Ron blankly.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,257
" 'How about: ""progress for progress's sake must be discouraged""?","order_of_the_phoenix",106,258
"How about: ""pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited""?'","order_of_the_phoenix",106,259
"said Ron impatiently.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,261
" 'I'll tell you what it means,' said Hermione through gritted teeth.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,262
"  'Oh yeah,' said Ron, who had obviously forgotten.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,267
" 'See you later,' he said dully to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring and pointing as he passed.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,283
" 'Hey, Harry,' said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,308
"  'Not bad,' muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,310
"  'Yeah, it was OK,' chuckled Dean.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,312
"said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,319
"said Harry, astonished.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,323
"said Harry quickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,331
" Well,' said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry's eye, she .","order_of_the_phoenix",106,334
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,344
" 'I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,372
"  'I'll talk to you how I want,' said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,374
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,385
"said Harry at the top of his voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,390
" 'Oh,' said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,391
"said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,397
"  'That's out of order, Seamus,' said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red - always a danger sign.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,399
"shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was going pale.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,401
"said Ron angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,404
" 'Then you're mad, too,' said Seamus in disgust.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,405
"said Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger.","order_of_the_phoenix",106,408

" 'I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec - '  'Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,' said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,312
"  'I wonder,' said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, 'how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me?","order_of_the_phoenix",110,316
" 'Well, it's a start,' said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,331
" Thirty-nine years this December,' said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,335
" 'I can hardly wait,' said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off towards the door.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,338
" 'Quite correct,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,345
" 'Hmm,' said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,349
" ' 'Fraid I can't,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,352
"  'Yes, please do,' said Professor Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,361
" 'Overall,' said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, 'how do you, as a temporary member of staff- an objective outsider,  I suppose you might say - how do you find Hogwarts?","order_of_the_phoenix",110,364
"  'Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,366
"  'Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in OWL,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,369
"  'Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,' said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,373
"said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,381
" 'Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,' said Harry angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,382
"  'Jolly good,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.*It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,388
" 'I still reckon you should complain about this,' said Ron in a low voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,395
" 'No,' said Harry flatly.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,396
" 'McGonagall would go nuts if she knew - '  'Yeah, she probably would,' said Harry dully.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,397
" 'She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,400
"  'I suggested poison,' said Ron grimly.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,406
"I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any Defence from her at all,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,410
"said Ron, yawning.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,412
"""S too late, isn't it?","order_of_the_phoenix",110,413
"  'Well,' said Hermione tentatively.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,416
"said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,422
" 'Well - learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,423
" 'Come off it,' groaned Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,424
"said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,428
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,431

"If we don't learn anything for a whole year - '  'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron in a defeated voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,435
"'I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose - '  'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,436
" 'No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,442
"said Harry, frowning at her.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,445
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,453
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,461
" 'You,' said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,462
" 'But I'm not a teacher, I can't - '  'Harry, you're the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,468
"said Harry now grinning more broadly than ever.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,470
"'No I'm rot, you've beaten me in every test - '  'Actually I haven't,' said Hermione coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,471
"  'But that was luck,' said Harry, 'it wasn't skill - '  'Second year,' Ron interrupted, 'you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.'","order_of_the_phoenix",110,483
"  'Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up, I - '  Third year,' said Ron, louder still, 'you fought off about a hundred Dementors at once - '  'You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't - '  'Last year,' Ron said, almost shouting now, 'you fought off You-know-Who again - '  'Listen to me!'","order_of_the_phoenix",110,484
"said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,485
"The whole time you're sure you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own - your own brain or guts or whatever - 'like you can think straight when you know you're about a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die - 'they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that - and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up - you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me -'  'We weren't saying anything like that, mate,' said Ron, looking aghast.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,499
"think about it,' said Hermione quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,520
" 'Yeah,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",110,534
"  'Course I have,' said Harry grumpily, 'can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us - '  'I meant the idea Ron and I had - ' Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,4
"said Hermione eagerly.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,14
" 'I dunno,' said Harry, playing for time.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,15
" 'I thought it was a good idea from the start,' said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,17
"  'Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, 'but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,20
"You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said - '  Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,21

"'I can have a pen-pal if I - '  'He didn't only want to be your pen-pal,' said Ron accusingly.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,30
"  'Well,' said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,34
"  'Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,' said Hermione seriously.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,47
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,51
" 'Because,' said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, 'I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,52
" 'Well, you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about,' said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,56
"  'I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,66
"  When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,68
"  'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,70
" 'I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,84
"  'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,92
"said Hermione, sceptically.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,96
"  'Oh - no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 'no, it's always packed and really noisy.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,110
" 'Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,126
"  'No,' said Harry drily, 'especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it?'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,145
" 'Three Butterbeers, please,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,151
" 'I'll get them,' said Harry quickly, passing over the silver.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,154
"I've always wanted to try Firewhisky - '  'You - are - a - prefect,' snarled Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,163
" 'Oh,' said Ron, the smile fading from his face.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,164
" First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,174

" 'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,187
"  'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,196
"  'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,197
" 'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,204
"well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,217

" 'Yeah,' said Harry slightly defensively.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,271
"  'Yes,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,282

"demanded Terry Boot.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,291
"  'Er - yeah, I did, yeah,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,295
" 'And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, 'he saved that Philological Stone - '  'Philosopher's,' hissed Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,299
" 'And that's not to mention,' said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) 'all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year - getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things .","order_of_the_phoenix",111,302
"  'Not with the dragon, you didn't,' said Michael Corner at once.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,318
"  'Yeah, well - ' said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,322
" 'And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,323
" 'No,' said Harry, 'no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is - '  'Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,324
" 'Here's an idea,' said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, 'why don't you shut your mouth?'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,326
" That's not what he said,' snarled Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,331
" 'Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,334
" 'Yes, well, said Hermione hastily, moving on .","order_of_the_phoenix",111,335
" 'Right,' said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,341
"I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week - '  'Hang on,' said Angelina, 'we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,343
"  'No,' said Cho, 'nor with ours.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,344
" 'I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,' said Hermione, slightly impatiently, 'but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters - '  'Well said!'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,346
"barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,347
"Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells - '  'We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione, 'is that she's got some .","order_of_the_phoenix",111,351
"said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,357
" 'Yes, he's got an army of Heliopaths,' said Luna solemnly.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,358
" 'Yes, he has,' said Luna.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,360
" They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, 'great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of - '  They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,363
"said Luna angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,365
"Just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you - '  'Hem, hem,' said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,369
"  'Yes,' said Hermione at once, 'yes, we were, you're right, Ginny.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,371
"  Well, once a week sounds cool,' said Lee Jordan.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,372
" 'Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,' said Hermione in a tense voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,374
"suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,380
" 'I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,381
"said Dean.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,383
" 'Yeah,' said Ron, 'McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Tri wizard.'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,384
" 'Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,387
" 'I - yes,' said Ernie, 'yes, I do believe that, it's just - '  'Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around?'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,411

"No, of course not,' said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,414
" 'Well, time's ticking on,' said Fred briskly, getting to his feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,420
" 'Well, I think that went quite well,' said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,425
" 'That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,427
"spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,431
"  'Well, that's why he and his friends came, I think - well, they're obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael what was going on - '  'When did this - when did she -?'","order_of_the_phoenix",111,433
"  'They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,' said Hermione composedly.","order_of_the_phoenix",111,434

" 'Me,' said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,55
"  'Well, it's an old-fashioned rule,' said Hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, 'but it says in Hogwarts: A History, that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,60
"said Ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,63
" 'They can't have done,' said Hermione in a low voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,68
" 'You're so naive,' said Ron, 'you think just because you're all honourable and trustworthy - '  'No, they can't have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,' said Hermione grimly.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,69
"'Believe me, if anyone's run off and told Umbridge, we'll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.'","order_of_the_phoenix",112,70

" 'Well, put it this way,' said Hermione, 'it'll make Eloise Midgeon's acne look like a couple of cute freckles.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,73
" 'Knew you'd say that,' said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,87
"said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,89

" 'It's OK,' said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,111
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,116
" 'No way,' said Ron, appalled.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,117
"  'OK, OK,' said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,126
"  'Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,' said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns's lesson.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,130
" 'Professor Binns,' said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,156
" 'Not at all well,' said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,161
"  'Yes,' said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,163
"  This is urgent,' said Harry curtly.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,180
"said Harry hastily.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,189
" 'Yes,' said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, 'she turned up after the other post owls and her wing's all funny, look - '  Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.","order_of_the_phoenix",112,196

"  'I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction, 'if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance .","order_of_the_phoenix",112,273

"said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,115
"  'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,202
" 'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,212
" 'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,221
"said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,225
"said Harry angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,231
" 'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,232
" 'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,234
"  'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '  'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,239
" 'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'","order_of_the_phoenix",118,240
" 'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,244
" Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,255
"  This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,261
"  'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,267
"  'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,269
" 'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,282
" 'Merry Christmas,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,290
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,293
" 'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,294
"  'Without a note,' added George.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,296
"  'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,298
"  'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,300
"said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back!'","order_of_the_phoenix",118,307
"  'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,308
"Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: 'If you've dotted the ""i""s and crossed the ""t""s then you may do whatever you please!'","order_of_the_phoenix",118,309
"  'No problem,' said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,316
" 'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,319
"'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free!'","order_of_the_phoenix",118,322
"  'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,323
"said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,326
" 'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,327
"said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,332
" 'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,334
"In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,346
" 'I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,349
"  'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, 'has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?'","order_of_the_phoenix",118,351
"  'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,352
"said Sirius, frowning.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,357
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,363
"'I mean, when you said ""out"", maybe he thought you meant get out of the house?'","order_of_the_phoenix",118,364
"They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,366
"  Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,375
"  'It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, 'but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid - '  'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,435
"  'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,438
"  'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,445
"  'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,448
"said Ron, his ears turning red.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,455
"said Ron furiously.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,458
"  'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,462
" 'Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, 'one more -  But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,463
"said Ron, also staring at the man.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,466
" 'Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,467
"said Ron, sounding slightly guilty.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,476
"  'Er - we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, 'Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors?","order_of_the_phoenix",118,482
"yeah, we have,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,489
"  'Er,' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, 'actually, we were just - er -'  But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of 'going to have a cup of tea' trailed away into nothingness.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,522
" This is our long-term residents' ward,' she informed Harry, Ron,  Hermione and Ginny in a low voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,527
"said Ron brightly, getting to his feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,567
"  'Er - thanks,' said Harry, shaking hands.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,578
"said Ron, looking amazed.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,591
"  'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,602
" 'I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,629
" 'Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,630
" 'Nor me,' whispered Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,631
"whispered Hermione, horrified.","order_of_the_phoenix",118,639
"In fact, if it hadn't been for the DA, Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,10
"said Harry blankly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,24
"said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs Weasley withdrew from the room.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,28
"said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,31
" 'Er,' said Harry, to announce his presence.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,36
"  'You know,' said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, 'I think I'd prefer it if you didn't give orders here, Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,39
" 'I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, 'but Black - '  'I'm his godfather,' said Sirius, louder than ever.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,43
"said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, 'but by all means stay, Black, I know you like lo feel .","order_of_the_phoenix",119,45
"said Sirius, letting his chair fall back on to all four legs with a loud bang.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,50
"said Harry blankly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,56
" 'Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,' said Snape smoothly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,68
"  'Yes,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,71
"  'I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,' said Snape silkily.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,81
" 'Wait a moment,' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,89
"  'I'll get to the point, then,' said Sirius, standing up.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,93
"  'Yes, I have,' said Sirius proudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,98
"said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,104
" 'I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, 'I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better - '  'Oh, but why don't you tell him so?'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,105
"whispered Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,106
"  'Speaking of dogs,' said Snape softly, 'did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside?","order_of_the_phoenix",119,110
"roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,120
" 'Why, yes, I suppose I am,' said Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,121
"snarled Sirius, pushing him aside with his free hand.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,123
" 'Nothing, Arthur,' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,140
"Instead, he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,158
" 'Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,159
"said Ron, sounding aghast.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,162
"said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,175
"  'OK,' said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,177
" 'Let's go, then,' said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,179
" 'Right - yeah,' said Harry distractedly; it was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfathers face and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief, one-armed hug, and saying gruffly, 'Look after yourself, Harry.'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,183
" 'Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,' said Tonks, and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,190
" A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said, 'Welcome to the - '  'Yes, yes, we know, thank you,' said Tonks swiftly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,193
" ""Ere - it's 'Any - '!'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,195
"  'If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,' muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forwards.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,196
" 'I've always wanted to go on this thing,' said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking around.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,197
" 'Looks like we'll have to split up,' said Tonks briskly, looking a.round for empty chairs.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,201
" 'Just outside Birmingham,' said Stan happily, answering Harry's unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,212
"From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a loud BANG.  'I've changed my mind,' muttered Ron, picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time, 'I never want to ride on this thing again.'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,223
"  'Listen, it's 'Ogwarts stop after this,' said Stan brightly, swaying towards them.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,224
" 'You'll be safe once you're in the grounds,' said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,236
"  'Look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,238
"  'Yeah, all right,' said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin's prematurely lined face.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,243
" 'Forget it,' said Harry dismally.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,259
" 'Oh,' said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,263
"  'We'll be in the library, Harry,' said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,265
" 'Yeah, not bad,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,268
" 'Mine was pretty quiet,' said Cho.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,269
"  'Right,' said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,280
"that's settled then,' said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,305
"In one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry - not without reason - of robbing.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,309
"  'Right,' said Harry tersely.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,320
" This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,' said Snape, his eyes narrowed malevolently, 'but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ""sir"" or ""Professor"" at all times.'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,321
"sir,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,325
"said Harry looking directly into Snape's eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,329
"said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,334
" 'You have no subtlety, Potter,' said Snape, his dark eyes glit-te'ing.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,335
" 'Only Muggles talk of ""mind-reading"".","order_of_the_phoenix",119,339
"  The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,' said Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,349
"  'Do not interrupt me, Potter,' said Snape in a dangerous voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,374
"said Harry quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,384
" 'I just wanted to know,' Harry began again, forcing his voice back to politeness, 'why - '  'You seem to have visited the snake's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,' snarled Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,393
"  'It seems so,' said Snape coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,396
"said Harry urgently.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,398
"  'I told you,' said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, 'to call me ""sir"".","order_of_the_phoenix",119,400
" 'Yes, sir,' said Harry impatiently, 'but how do you know - '?","order_of_the_phoenix",119,401
" 'It is enough that we know,' said Snape repressively.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,402
" 'He might,' said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,408
" 'You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,' said Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,416
" 'I am about to attempt to break into your mind,' said Snape softly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,419
" 'No,' said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,453
" 'I thought not,' said Snape, watching him closely.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,454
" 'Flashes of it,' said Snape, his lip curling.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,459
" 'Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,' said Snape, raising his wand once more.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,462
"  'I'm trying,' said Harry angrily, 'but you're not telling me how!'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,466
"  'Manners, Potter,' said Snape dangerously.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,467
"said Snape sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,511
"said Snape savagely.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,522
"  'I am not weak,' said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,525
" 'And why,' said Snape slowly, 'would you ask such a thing?'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,575
"  'Because,' said Harry, watching Snape's face closely, 'that corridor I've just seen - I've been dreaming about it for montns - I've just recognised it - it leads to the Department of Mysteries .","order_of_the_phoenix",119,576
"  'Fine,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,588
"  'Yes,' said Harry, who was barely listening.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,591
" 'And be warned, Potter .","order_of_the_phoenix",119,592
"I dunno,' said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot through his scar again.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,616
"whispered Ron, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly 'that the weapon - the thing You-Know-Who's after - is in the Ministry of Magic?'","order_of_the_phoenix",119,630
"said Ron rather impatiently.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,636
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,645
"  'I know they call the people who work in there ""Unspeakables"",' said Ron, frowning.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,653
"  'It's not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,655
"  I expect anyone would feel snaky if they'd had their mind attacked over and over again,' said Hermione sympathetically.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,672
"shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,676
"shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,682
"said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,684
"said Hermione encouragingly.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,692
" 'I think I'll go to bed,' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,698
"  'Something good's happened,' mumbled Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,741
" 'Hermione told me to come and check on you,' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",119,747
"said Harry and Ron together.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,4
"said Harry loudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,18
"whispered Hermione desperately.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,21
"There you are, Harry,' said Ron, looking awestruck.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,31
"  'I don't believe this,' snarled Harry, 'Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?'","order_of_the_phoenix",120,33
"said Hermione bitterly.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,35
"'He can hardly say, ""Sorry, everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort"" - stop whimpering, Ron - ""and now Voldemort's worst supporters have broken out, too.""","order_of_the_phoenix",120,36
" 'Oh my - ' said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,47
"said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,49
"horrible,' said Hermione, looking shaken.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,53
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,64
"said Ron sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,82
"said Hermione shakily.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,86
"said Ron, startled.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,104
" To send a letter,' said Hermione, swinging her bag on to her shoulder.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,105
"said Ron very loudly, so that many of the passing students looked around curiously.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,128
" They obviously can't talk freely in the staff room any more,' said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,157
"said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,160
"said Harry angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,162
" 'Maybe it's a bit like an illness,' said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,203
"  The lessons with Snape are making it worse,' said Harry flatly 'I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night.'","order_of_the_phoenix",120,206
"'I just wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at it - '  That's not funny,' said Hermione sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",120,208

" That's right,' said Dumbledore pleasantly.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,483
"  'I did,' said Dumbledore.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,485
"  'Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,' said Dumbledore, nodding.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,487
" That's right,' said Dumbledore cheerfully.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,494
"shouted Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,496
"  'Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,' said Dumbledore calmly.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,499
"'Well, well, well - I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead - '  'Instead you get to arrest me,' said Dumbledore, smiling.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,502

"said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,510
"  'Ah,' said Dumbledore gently, 'yes.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,515
"  Well,' said Dumbledore apologetically, 'I'm afraid I do.'","order_of_the_phoenix",122,520
" 'Don't be silly, Dawlish,' said Dumbledore kindly.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,532
"'I'm sure you are an excellent Auror - I seem to remember that you achieved ""Outstanding"" in all your NEWTs - but if you attempt to - er - 'bring me in by force, I will have to hurt you.'","order_of_the_phoenix",122,533
"  'Merlin's beard, no,' said Dumbledore, smiling, 'not unless you are foolish enough to force me to.'","order_of_the_phoenix",122,537
"said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging her hand inside her robes.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,539
"said Dumbledore sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,541
"said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,561
" 'Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,' said Dumbledore in a low voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,566
"whispered Professor McGonagall.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,569
"  'Oh no,' said Dumbledore, with a grim smile, 'I am not leaving to go into hiding.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,571
" 'Remember - close your mind - '  But as Dumbledore's fingers closed over Harry's skin, a pa n shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him - '  ' - you will understand,' whispered Dumbledore.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,583
"shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",122,591

"  'Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head's office,' said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,12
" 'It's only teachers who can dock points from houses, Malfoy,' said Ernie at once.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,17
"snarled Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,19
"said Hermione sharply.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,23
" 'The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,' said Malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver 'I' on his robes just beneath his prefect's badge.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,24
"  'Wise move, Granger,' breathed Malfoy.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,35
" 'He was bluffing,' said Ernie, looking appalled.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,46
" 'Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,' said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour-glass.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,61
" 'Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,62
" 'What do you mean, ""tried""?'","order_of_the_phoenix",123,63
"said Ron quickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,64
" 'He never managed to get all the words out,' said Fred, 'due to the fact that we forced him head-first into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor.'","order_of_the_phoenix",123,65
"  'Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him,' said Fred coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,68
" 'Course we have,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,75
"  'We've always known where to draw the line,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,77
" We might have put a toe across it occasionally,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,78
" 'But we've always stopped short of causing real mayhem,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,79
"said Ron tentatively.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,81
" 'Well, now -' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,82
" ' - what with Dumbledore gone - ' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,83
" ' - we reckon a bit of mayhem - ' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,84
" ' - is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,' said Fred.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,85
"whispered Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,87
"said Fred, smiling at her.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,91
"said Hermione anxiously.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,97
" 'You'll see,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,98
" 'I think we should get out of here, you know,' said Hermione nervously.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,102
"'Just in case  'Yeah, all right,' said Ron, and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed the day's ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose-to-nose with Filch the caretaker.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,103
" 'I didn't do it,' said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,106
"  'I've noticed,' said Harry coldly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,115
" 'Sit,' said Umbridge curtly, pointing towards a chair.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,136
"said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,143
" 'Nothing, thank you,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,149
"tea then,' said Harry shrugging.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,155
"said Umbridge, who was still watching him closely.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,170
"  'No,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,172
"  'No idea,' said Harry promptly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,182
" 'Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, 'let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,198
"  'No idea,' said Harry loudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,204
"cried Umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,224
"shrieked Umbridge, 'they'll be all over the school unless we do something - Stupefy!'","order_of_the_phoenix",123,235
"shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been his incantation.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,239
"  'Cheers,' whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,251
" 'Dear, dear,' said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,258
"said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,263
" Thanks,' said George, looking both surprised and pleased.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,269
"  'It was worth it, though,' said Fred, who was taking orders from clamouring Gryffindors.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,272
"said Hermione brightly, as a silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,278
" 'Now you mention it,' said Hermione happily, 'd'you know .","order_of_the_phoenix",123,282
"said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,360
" 'Over here,' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,377
"  'Oh, no,' said Cho hurriedly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,381
"  'Yeah, well,' said Harry moodily.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,390
" 'She's a lovely person really,' said Cho.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,392
"said Cho pleadingly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,400
"'And in case you hadn't noticed, he hasn't got sneak written across his face - '  That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Cho fiercely.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,403
"'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list - '  'I think it was a brilliant idea,' said Harry coldly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,404
" 'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea - '  'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,406
" 'You're late, Potter,' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,420
"said Snape smoothly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,427
" 'On the count of three then,' said Snape lazily.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,431
" 'It's all right, Draco,' said Snape, lowering his wand.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,434
" 'It's Professor Umbridge, sir - she needs your help,' said Malfoy.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,441
"demanded Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,444
"Potter,' said Snape, 'we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.'","order_of_the_phoenix",123,447
"squeaked Professor Flitwick.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,569
" Loved it, said Lupin briskly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,587
"said James in tones of mock concern.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,591
" 'Think I did,' said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,592
"said James impatiently.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,598
"'I'll be surprised if I don't get ""Outstanding"" on it at least.'","order_of_the_phoenix",123,605
"  'Me too,' said James.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,606
"  'Nicked it,' said James casually.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,609
" 'Put that away, will you,' said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer, 'before Wormtail wets himself with excitement.'","order_of_the_phoenix",123,623
" 'I'm bored,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,627
"  'You might,' said Lupin darkly from behind his book.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,629
"  'This'll liven you up, Padfoot,' said James quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,637
"said James loudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,647
"said James.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,660
" 'I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,' said Sirius viciously.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,661
"  Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,663
"said Sirius coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,668
" 'Wash out your mouth,' said James coldly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,671
"said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,680
"  'Well,' said James, appearing to deliberate the point, 'it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean .","order_of_the_phoenix",123,684
"  Many of the surrounding students laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn't, and nor did Lily.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,687
"  'I will if you go out with me, Evans,' said James quickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,691
" 'I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,' said Lily.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,698
" 'Bad luck, Prongs,' said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,699
" Many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius, James and Wormtail roared with laughter.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,703
"  'Certainly,' said James and he jerked his wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,705
" 'Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,' said James earnestly.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,712
"yelped James.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,726
"said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,735
" 'Reading between the lines, I'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,736
" 'Right,' said James, who looked furious now, 'right - '  There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,737
" 'So,' said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,745
"  'N-no,' said Harry, trying to free his arm.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,750
"said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,753
" 'No,' said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could.","order_of_the_phoenix",123,758
"said Hermione, frowning.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,2
"said Hermione sceptically.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,6
" 'Pretty much,' said Harry, not looking at her.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,7
"said Hermione indignantly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,9
"'Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask - '  'No,' said Harry forcefully.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,10
" 'I dunno,' said Ron, 'there's been a lot going on.'","order_of_the_phoenix",124,18
"  'That's for Quidditch practice,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,22
"he said dully.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,25
" 'I saw Cho earlier,' said Hermione tentatively.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,34
"  'Wha- oh, yeah, we have,' said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,39
"  That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,41
"said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,43
"Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been?","order_of_the_phoenix",124,50
" 'Oh, hi,' said Harry, pulling his books towards him.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,88
"  'It's over,' said Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,90
" 'It's Easter eggs from Mum,' said Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,101
" 'Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,110
"  'It's not Cho I want to talk to,' said Harry brusquely.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,117
" 'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.'","order_of_the_phoenix",124,129
"  'Come on,' said Harry dully.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,130
"  The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'","order_of_the_phoenix",124,132
"  'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,136
" 'Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,145
"'It says here you need at least ""E"" at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,147
"said Hermione absently.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,156
"  'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,159
"  'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'","order_of_the_phoenix",124,167
"'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,170
"said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,173
"said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '  'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,177
"  'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,179
"  'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'","order_of_the_phoenix",124,190
"  'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,191
"said Hermione in a hushed voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,195
" 'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,197
"  'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,202
" 'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,205
"  'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,207
" 'Easy,' said George.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,211
" 'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,214
"  'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'","order_of_the_phoenix",124,240
"said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,257
" 'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,269
" 'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,272
"  'Er - ' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,274
"Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,277
" 'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,279
"They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under ""Exceeds Expectations"" grade, I see.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,280
" 'Yes,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,288
"  'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,290
"And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved ""Exceeds Expectations"" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,294
"I'd say you're averaging ""Acceptable"" at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,295
"And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than ""Outstanding"" in their OWLs, so - '  Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,299
" 'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,302
"  'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,304
"said Professor Umbridge sweetly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,306
"said Professor McGonagall haughtily.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,308
"I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ""Acceptable"" and ""Exceeds Expectations"" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,310
"said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,316
" 'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,320
"'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '  'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '  'I should have made my meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,326
"  'Yes,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,332
"  'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,334
"It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '  'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,335
"  'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,338
" 'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,339
" 'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,340

"  'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,359
"whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from  Umbridge.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,385
"  'Yeah,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,440
"  'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, 'he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again .","order_of_the_phoenix",124,442
"said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,450
"  'No,' said Harry, 'it's nothing like that .","order_of_the_phoenix",124,454
"He was only fifteen - '  'I'm fifteen' said Harry heatedly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,465
" 'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you?","order_of_the_phoenix",124,466
"  'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,469
" 'I'm not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,470
" Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, 'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - '  'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,471
" 'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,473
" 'I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,475
"said Lupin eagerly.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,477
" 'Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently.","order_of_the_phoenix",124,478
"said Sirius bracingly, 'we were all idiots!","order_of_the_phoenix",124,484

" 'Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,' said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, 'not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.'","order_of_the_phoenix",127,316

"muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge's door.","order_of_the_phoenix",127,367

"shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face.","order_of_the_phoenix",127,622

" 'It is not for you to set conditions,' said Professor Umbridge harshly.","order_of_the_phoenix",127,657
" 'Fine,' said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again.","order_of_the_phoenix",127,658
"  'Professor,' said Malfoy eagerly, 'Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after - '  'I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?'","order_of_the_phoenix",127,672
"  'All right,' said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed.","order_of_the_phoenix",127,676
" 'And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,' said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand.","order_of_the_phoenix",127,677

"  'Of course,' said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,26
" 'No, I don't think so, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,36
" 'Oh yes,' said Hermione, 'yes, it's well hidden.'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,42

"Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian, she continued, 'Law Fifteen ""B"" states clearly that ""any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions - '  ' ""Near-human intelligence""?'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,86
"said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,94
"shouted Hermione, but it was too late: Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, 'Incarcerous!'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,104

"squealed Hermione, terrified.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,194
" 'Oh no,' said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,204
"  'I'm not that fussed, to be honest,' said Harry bitterly.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,207
"  'We need to get back up to the castle,' said Hermione faintly.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,215
"said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,217
" 'Well, we can't do anything without wands,' said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,219
" 'So,' said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry's wand, 'had any ideas?'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,226
" 'Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,' said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione's wand, too.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,229
"  'She got carried away,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,233
" 'No, they got chased off by Grawp,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,237
" 'Hagrid's little brother,' said Ron promptly.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,240
"  'Yes,' said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, 'and I'm sure Sirius is still alive, but I can't see how we're going to get there to help him.'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,244
"said Luna, in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,247
" 'OK,' said Harry irritably, rounding on her.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,248
"'First of all, ""we"" aren't doing anything if you're including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron's me only one with a broomstick that isn't being guarded by a security troll, so - '  'I've got a broom!'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,249
"said Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,250
" 'Yeah, but you're not coming,' said Ron angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,251
"said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,253
" 'You're too - ' Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, 'I'm three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosophers Stone, and it's because of me that Malfoy's stuck back in Umbridge's office with giant flying bogies attacking him - '  'Yeah, but - '  'We were all in the DA together,' said Neville quietly.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,254
"  'No - of course it wasn't - ' said Harry impatiently.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,257
" 'Then we should come too,' said Neville simply.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,258
"  'That's right,' said Luna, smiling happily.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,260
" 'Well, it doesn't matter, anyway,' said Harry through gritted teeth, 'because we still don't know how to get there - '  'I thought we'd settled that,' said Luna maddeningly.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,263
"  'Look,' said Ron, barely containing his anger, 'you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can't sprout wings whenever we - '  There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,' said Luna serenely.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,265
" The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can't fly,' said Luna in a dignified voice, 'but they can, and Hagrid says they're very good at finding places their riders are looking for.'","order_of_the_phoenix",128,268
"said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,275
"  'Yeah,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,277
"  'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,280
" 'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,281
" 'I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,282
"said Harry angrily.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,284
" 'OK, fine, it's your choice,' he said curtly, 'but unless we can find more Thestrals you're not going to be able - '  'Oh, more of them will come,' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,288
"said Hermione furiously.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,294
" There's no need,' said Luna, smiling.","order_of_the_phoenix",128,295
"said Ron faintly.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,10
"  'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,12
"if I could just see it - '  'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,22
" If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack .","order_of_the_phoenix",129,64
" 'Come on, said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed Harry's wand had sat, and which was now deserted.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,118
" 'OK, listen,' said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the door.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,127
"  'We're coming with you, Harry,' said Neville.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,134
" 'Let's get on with it,' said Ron firmly.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,135
"whispered Ron fearfully.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,154
" 'I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through,' said Ginny in a hushed voice.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,155
"said Neville uncomfortably.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,158
" 'Well, that doesn't matter now,' said Harry forcefully, blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever, 'we won't need to get out till we've found Sirius - '  'Don't go calling for him, though!'","order_of_the_phoenix",129,159
"whispered Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,175
" 'Dunno,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,176
"breathed Ginny.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,178
"said Luna excitedly.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,180
"'Dad said the Ministry were breeding - '  'No,' said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,181
" 'Let's get out of here,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,193
"  There are doors here, too,' said Ron, pointing around the walls.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,195
"said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,201
" 'Good thinking,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,205
"said Harry, jumping down on to the bench below.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,212
"whispered Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,215
" 'Let's go,' called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,224
"Said Hermione more forcefully.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,229
"said Hermione, now moving over to him.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,236
"  'I'm here, mate,' said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,239
" 'I can hear them too,' breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,242
"  'What do you mean, ""in there""?'","order_of_the_phoenix",129,244
"demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted, 'there isn't any ""in there"", it's just an archway, there's no room for anybody to be there.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,245
"said Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,259
"said Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,269
"said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, but it didn't budge.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,276
"said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,278

"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,285

"said Ron, staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,292
" 'It can't be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,' said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,293
"said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,295
" 'Something blibbering, no doubt,' said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,296
"said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,305
"said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,309
" 'You said it was row ninety-seven,' whispered Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,321
" 'Yeah,' breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,322
" 'We need to go right, I think,' whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,324
"whispered Hermione.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,351
" 'He's right down at the end,' said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,354
" 'He should be near here,' whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,359
"said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,367
"said Hermione again.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,387
"said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,413
"said Harry, but eagerly this time - it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,415
" 'It's - it's got your name on,' said Ron.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,419
"said Harry blankly.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,423
"  'Harry, I don't think you should touch it,' said Hermione sharply, as he stretched out his hand.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,433
"  'Don't, Harry,' said Neville suddenly.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,437
" 'It's got my name on,' said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",129,441
" 'To me,' said Malfoy yet again.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,5
"  'Always,' echoed Malfoy softly.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,9
" 'You've got him,' said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,15
"  'Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,' said Malfoy softly.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,25
"  'I know Sirius is here,' said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,28
" 'It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,' said Malfoy.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,31
"  'Go on, then,' said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,33
" 'Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,' said Malfoy coolly.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,40
" 'So,' said Harry, 'what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway?'","order_of_the_phoenix",130,68
"  'Nope, not jesting,' said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,75
" 'Yeah,' said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,80
"said Harry recklessly.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,84
"bawled Malfoy.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,101
" 'Do not play games with us, Potter,' said Malfoy.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,115
" 'I'm not playing games,' said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,116
"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,124
"whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,128

"said Harry.","order_of_the_phoenix",130,137
