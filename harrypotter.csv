Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,"" said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""And so you met Tom Riddle,"" said Dumbledore thoughtfully."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,"" said Dumbledore calmly, ""because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue."

Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Definitely not,"" said George, sniggering."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny,"  ""That's what I told Ginny,"" said Percy fiercely, ""but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -""  ""You don't care about Ginny,"" said Ron, whose ears were now  *157*  reddening."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny,"   ""Oh, that,"" said Ginny, giggling."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny,"  ""It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,"" said Ginny."

Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Er - hello,"" said Harry nervously."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Th-thank you,"" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,"" said Harry quickly, ""but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?"""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Sit down,"" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed."

Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""You know we're not supposed to do spells outside school -""  ""You should talk,"" said Harry, staring at the floating car."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead,"" said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I don't think he could,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry and Ron together, instantly."

Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Come on,"" said Harry wearily, ""we'd better get up to the school ......"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""So did I,"" said Harry, taking one, too."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Er -"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"There was a slight stiffness in the way she said ""Morning,"" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived."

Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature,"" she told Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""it could affect our whole future,"" she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I just want to give up Potions,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No idea,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password -""  ""Exactly,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Percy's in shock,"" George told Harry quietly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""We've got to go and talk to him,"" said Harry, making up his mind."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""But McGonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're in class -"" ""I think,"" said Harry, more quietly still, ""it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Come on, Fang, we're going for a walk,"" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""Oh, no, oh, no, oh -""  ""Shut up,"" said Harry frantically."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hagrid's in trouble,"" said Harry, breathing very fast."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,"" said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,"" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  (ti agree, sir,"" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""We were going to - to go and see -""  ""Hermione,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"What if it's in -"" `= Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, ""said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""This means,"" said Harry, ""I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""Let's go to the staff room,"" said Harry, jumping up."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""No,"" said Harry, glancing around."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -""  ""Professor, we've got some information for you,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Shouldn't have let Professor Snape teach us that one,"" said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart's trunk aside."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""You're in luck,"" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""To ask you how you died,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""We must be miles under the school,"" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"And, Harry -""  ""See you in a bit,"" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Open, ""said Harry, in a low, faint hiss."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Thanks,"" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Listen,"" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Look,"" said Harry, losing patience, ""I don't think you get it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust -""  ""Hagrid's my friend,"" said Harry, his voice now shaking."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,"" said Harry, his teeth gritted."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well, you haven't finished it,"" said Harry triumphantly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,"" said Harry, breathing fast."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,"" said Harry abruptly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Fawkes,"" said Harry thickly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"The last thing I r- remember is him coming out of the diary --""  "" It's all right,"" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, ""Riddle's finished."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""He's Dumbledore's,"" said Harry, squeezing through himself  ""How come you've got a sword?"""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I'll explain when we get out of here,"" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -""  ""Fawkes,"" said Harry, ""isn't an ordinary bird."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""It was this diary,"" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""It only put me in Gryffindor,"" said Harry in a defeated voice, ""because I asked not to go in Slytherin ."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Because you gave it to her,"" said Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Least I could do, Dobby,"" said Harry, grinning."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I've just got one question, Dobby,"" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Right,"" said Harry weakly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""It's `wattlebird,""' said Hermione impatiently, ""but that's not the point - ""  Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's all right, he's still alive,"" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," s1  ""Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,"" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Defense Against the Dark Arts,"" said Hermione at once."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,"" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing -""  ""Rubbish,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,"" said Hermione sharply."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Nearly there, Ron,"" said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop,"" said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Malfoy called Hermione something - it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh, no,"" said Hermione, stopping abruptly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,"" said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No thanks,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,"" said Hermione, glaring at Peeves."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh, dear,"" said Hermione sadly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," *141*  ""The same reason everyone else wants it,"" said Hermione, ""to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"I can't remember,"" said Hermione, biting her lip."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No, I won't,"" said Hermione, suddenly severe."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,"" said Hermione in a clear voice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I never knew that,"" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there,"" said Hermione, standing up and coming over."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -""  ""Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,"" said Hermione quickly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well,"" said Hermione cautiously, ""I suppose it's possible ......"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""There might be a way,"" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""All right,"" said Hermione coldly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No, it's not,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""It wears off after a while,"" said Hermione, waving her hand  *159*  impatiently."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""I think,"" said Hermione, ""that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ......"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Wait till everyone's gone,"" said Hermione nervously."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"   ""Oh, yes,"" said Hermione eagerly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""But who cares, we've got what we needed -""  ""He is not a brainless git,"" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Here it is,"" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen,"" said Hermione as they scanned the recipe."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Anyone can make a mistake,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,"" said Hermione darkly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Maybe it can make itself invisible,"" said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""What we need,"" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, ""is a diversion."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""It matters,"" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, ""because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You'll find that hard to prove,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""For heaven's sake, Harry,"" said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Not for long,"" said Hermione in a satisfied tone."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Merry Christmas to you, too,"" said Hermione, throwing him his present."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Positive,"" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,"" said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I'm sure I've done everything right,"" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Add yours, then,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up,"" said Hermione briskly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Just a get well card,"" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oooh, it might have hidden powers,"" said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""And this diary is fifty years old,"" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"probably top of every class -""  ""You say that like it's a bad thing,"" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Riddle might have got the wrong person,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""But the monster had killed someone, Ron,"" said Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Justin," ""So anyway,"" a stout boy was saying, ""I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Lockhart," ""And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Famous Harry Potter,"" said Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,"" retorted Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Be careful, Weasley,"" sneered Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,"" said Malfoy, smugly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Whatever,"" said Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Wait here,"" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,"" said Malfoy scornfully."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,"" said Malfoy, snickering."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend,"" said Malfoy slowly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then  ""I wish I knew who it is,"" said Malfoy petulantly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"whoever it was was expelled,"" said Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,"" said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief ""Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""When I've had a look,"" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,"" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, ""but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," 'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?"""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Sir,"" said Malfoy loudly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Yeah, right,"" said Malfoy, smirking."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""I - I didn't think -""  ""That,"" said Professor McGonagall, ""is obvious."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"He cleared his throat and said, ""Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -""  * 8i  ""It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,"" said Dumbledore calmly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"""Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -"" ""The Sorting Ceremony is over,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Certainly not,"" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Really, Severus,"" said Professor McGonagall sharply, ""I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""There was a bunch of grapes next to him,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Yes,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Professor,"" said Harry at once, ""I swear I didn't -""  ""This is out of my hands, Potter,"" said Professor McGonagall curtly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""This will be a bit of a shock,"" said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""They were found near the library,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,"" said Professor McGonagall heavily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, ""Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""The Heir of Slytherin,"" said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, ""left another message."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Ginny Weasley,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -""  ""We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Right,"" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,  ""that's got him out from under our feet."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""I think we'd all like to know that,"" said Professor McGonagall weakly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Right,"" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle," ""I wasn't paying attention,"" said Myrtle dramatically."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle," ""You'll be teased something dreadful,"" said Myrtle happily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle,"I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,"" said Myrtle, glaring at them."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle," ""No idea,"" said Myrtle in hushed tones."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle,"  ""Somewhere there,"" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle," ""That tap's never worked,"" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle,"if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet,"" said Myrtle, blushing silver."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Neville," ""Amazing,"" said Neville, awestruck."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Neville," ""You'd better open it, Ron,"" said Neville in a timid whisper."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Nick," ""You look troubled, young Potter,"" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Nick," ""You'd better get out of here, Harry,"" said Nick quickly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Nick," ""I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,"" said Nick eagerly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Nick," ""But there is something you could do for me,"" said Nick excitedly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Nick," ""Welcome, Patrick,"" said Nick stiffly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Morning, all,"" said Percy briskly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""That's what I told Ginny,"" said Percy fiercely, ""but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -""  ""You don't care about Ginny,"" said Ron, whose ears were now  *157*  reddening."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""No, I haven't,"" said Percy, his smile fading."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Well, get off to your dormitories,"" said Percy sternly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""I,"" said Percy, drawing himself up, ""am a prefect."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Hand it over, Malfoy,"" said Percy sternly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say  ""Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,"" said Percy at once."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Oh,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""No,"" said Riddle at once."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Yes, sir,"" said Riddle, reddening slightly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""Half-blood, sir,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""No, sir,"" said Riddle quickly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""I had to see the headmaster, sir,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Evening, Rubeus,"" said Riddle sharply."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Come on, Rubeus,"" said Riddle, moving yet closer."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""Stand aside,"" said Riddle, drawing out his wand."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""She's still alive,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""A memory,"" said Riddle quietly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"If the basilisk comes -""  ""It won't come until it is called,"" said Riddle calmly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"  ""I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"We can talk later -""  ""We're going to talk now,"" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Well, that's an interesting question,"" said Riddle pleasantly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""The diary,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Yes,"" said Riddle, calmly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,"" said Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,"" said Riddle carelessly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -""  ""Haven't I already told you,"" said Riddle quietly, ""that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Well,"" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, ""how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""Voldemort,"" said Riddle softly, ""is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter ."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""That's a phoenix	said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle,"Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently  ""And that -"" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, ""that's the old school Sorting Hat -""  So it was."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Riddle," ""To business, Harry,"" said Riddle, still smiling broadly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""He works for the Ministry,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh, this doesn't count,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with -""  ""I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -""  ""Stop gibbering,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""But you can't magic me out either -""  ""We don't need to,"" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Let Hedwig out,"" he told Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""But Percy wouldn't lend him to me,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Er, no,"" said Ron, ""he had to work tonight."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""He works in the most boring department,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's not much,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Right,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Ginny,"" said Ron in an undertone to Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,"" Harry told Ron  they crossed the lawn."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,"" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, ""like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods ."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""They'll be back,"" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Ginny,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""The Chudley Cannons,"" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's a bit small,"" said Ron quickly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He's never traveled by Floo powder,"" said Ron suddenly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""The soot -""  ""Don't fidget,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We've never been allowed in,"" said Ron enviously."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""This is for the Daily Prophet -""  ""Big deal,"" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh, it's you,"" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's gone,"" said Ron, sounding stunned."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Check that no one's watching,"" said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Due north,"" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.  ""All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's probably just tired,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Not far,"" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, ""not far now,"" and he patted the dashboard nervously."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron, into the silence."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""My wand,"" said Ron, in a shaky voice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving  ""Run for it!"""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I think the feast's already started,"" said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We'll go and get our stuff,"" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Not much,"" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Oh, good,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She didn't want us showing off,"" said Ron sagely."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Skip the lecture,"" said Ron impatiently, ""and tell us the new password."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She's - she's sent me a Howler,"" said Ron faintly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,"" said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Why, ""demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, ""have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?"""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Eat slugs, Malfoy,"" said Ron angrily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You could've fried an egg on your face"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It was bad,"" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"I could tell it was really rude, of course -""  ""It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,"" gasped Ron, coming back up."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's a disgusting thing to call someone,"" said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No thanks,"" said Ron weakly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Filch'll have me there all night,"" said Ron heavily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Careful not to walk through anyone,"" said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"I feel sick,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Pudding might not be finished yet,"" said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Trust me,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""We weren't hungry,"" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""No,"" said Ron, without hesitation."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""'Course I do,"" said Ron quickly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You know, it rings a sort of bell,"" said Ron slowly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short	said Ron fu  riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Somewhere over there,"" said Ron, pointing along the shelves."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"I thought he was a bit of an idiot,"" said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""And I can't find the story anywhere else -""  ""Hermione, let me read your composition,"" said Ron desperately, checking his watch."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""People here'll believe anything,"" said Ron in disgust."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I - don't - like - spiders,"" said Ron tensely."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," *154*  ""I don't mind them dead,"" said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's not funny,"" said Ron, fiercely."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It was about here,"" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Can't go in there,"" said Ron gruffly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm ""  ""Already dead,"" said Ron helpfully."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That's what I told Ginny,"" said Percy fiercely, ""but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -""  ""You don't care about Ginny,"" said Ron, whose ears were now  *157*  reddening."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Let's think,"" said Ron in mock puzzlement."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,"" said Ron, frowning."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Hard to see why we'd want the book, really,"" said Ron, ""if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That's because he's a brainless git,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh, come on,"" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in ='   ""I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""We won, though,"" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"You've got to be joking,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"That's why we decided we'd better get going -""  ""The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,"" snarled Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""This settles it,"" said Ron in a triumphant voice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -""  ""You read too much, Hermione,"" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He knew it was me,"" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Snape can't prove it was you,"" said Ron reassuringly to Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Oh, no they can't,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"You were there - you heard me -""  ""I heard you speaking Parseltongue,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Exactly,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,"" said Ron knowingly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -"" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,"" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Good thinking,"" said Ron, unlocking the door."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""This is unbelievable,"" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That looks more like Goyle,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,"" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Excuse me,"" said Ron, hurrying up to her."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"   ""Wh - oh, yeah,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,"" said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I was so sure it was Malfoy,"" said Ron, for about the hundredth time."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You'd be surprised,"" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Hang on,"" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,"" said Ron resentfully."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Well, it's not much use to you,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""If it has, it's hiding them very well,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Could've been anything,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,"" said Ron, ""with just one tiny little flaw."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (""Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,"" said Ron)."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He sounds like Percy,"" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That'd be a cheerful visit,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We can't,"" said Ron gloomily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Not the way Lockhart teaches it,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Someone's been looking for something,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Loads more than I do,"" said Ron, shaking his head."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Because that's what Hermione does,"" said Ron, shrugging."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You'd better get moving,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That's clever of you,"" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"What're you -""   Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.  ""Oh, yeah,"" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,"" Harry told Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Right,"" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh, yes he would,"" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""'Course,"" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, ""we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Good thinking,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We've come this far,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh, no,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Probably getting ready to pounce,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Follow the spiders,"" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just  three toilets away,"" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,  ""and we could've asked her, and now."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Spit it out,"" said Ron, watching her."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That's right,"" said Ron, catching on."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That,"" said Ron fervently, ""was the best story you've ever come up with."""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She knew something, Harry,"" said Ron, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Harry"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Harry,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Me too,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Under the lake, probably,"" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Harry - there's something up there -"" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Blimey,"" said Ron weakly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Get up,"" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," There was a very pregnant pause,  ""I'll try and shift some of this rock,"" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Back there,"" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""His memory's gone,"" said Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""No,"" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"Professor Lockhart --""  ""He means you,"" said Ron sharply to Lockhart."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Shame,"" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""This is called a telephone number,"" he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Seamus,"  ""But, sir,"" said Seamus Finnigan, ""if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?"""
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Follow me,"" said Snape."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""If I might speak, Headmaster,"" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -""  ""Excuse me,"" said Snape icily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""I don't think so,"" said Snape, smiling coldly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"""Let's have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you -""  ""A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,"" said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Don't move, Potter,"" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""Now, now, Malfoy,"" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin- lipped smile."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"""I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands -""  ""Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,"" barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"I don't recall -""  ""I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,"" said Snape."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout,"Ten points to Gryffindor,"" said Professor Sprout."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout,"Take another ten points,"" said Professor Sprout."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout," ""Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,"" said Professor Sprout."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout," ""When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,"" said Professor Sprout."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout," When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, ""Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Book_Tom," ""Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Uncle,"  ""Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,"" said Uncle Vernon heartily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Uncle," ""This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, "" said Uncle Vernon."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""I think we should run through the schedule one more time,"" said Uncle Vernon."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Uncle," ""Excellent, Dudley,"" said Uncle Vernon."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Book_Uncle," ""Exactly,"" said Uncle Vernon nastily."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""Too right, you will,"" said Uncle Vernon forcefully."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Book_Uncle," ""You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,"" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"Miss Delacour ¨C """"I'm taking Fleur on a thestral,"" said Bill."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"We saw it,"" said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window."

Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"Up here, then,"" said Bill, leading the way."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"In here,"" said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur's room, it too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"""And paid for by wizards,"" said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"""Lupin,"" muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"I know goblins,"" said Bill."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"We are talking about a different breed of being,"" said Bill."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"All I am saying,"" said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, ""is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"We've told Bill and Fleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get up to see us off."""

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""At these times,"" said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, ""I use the Pensieve."

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes, they were talking about Nevilles parents,"" said Dumbledore."

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""The Longbottoms were very popular,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"has never been accused of any Dark activity since,"" said Dumbledore calmly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway -  ""There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts!"

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""He is simply Stunned, Winky,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I would like you to tell us,"" said Dumbledore softly, ""how you came to be here."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""So you took the wand,"" said Dumbledore, ""and what did you do with it?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"But first -""  ""You needed Alastor Moody,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""But your father escaped,"" said Dumbledore."

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,"" Harry told Dumbledore."

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""They will not work properly against each other,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Which means,"" said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry's face, ""that some form of Cedric must have reappeared."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""No spell can reawaken the dead,"" said Dumbledore heavily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""An echo,"" said Dumbledore, ""which retained Cedric's appearance and character."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""The last murders the wand performed,"" said Dumbledore, nodding."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I will say it again,"" said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,"" said Dumbledore simply."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,"" said Dumbledore, ""we heard Barty Crouch confess."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,""  said Dumbledore steadily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Certainly, I believe Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Listen to me, Cornelius,"" said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,"" said Dumbledore, ""or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants -people hate them, Dumbledore - end of my career -""  ""You are blinded,"" said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, ""by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius!"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,"" said Dumbledore, ""we have reached a parting of the ways."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"But if you're going to work against me -""  ""The only one against whom I intend to work,"" said Dumbledore, ""is Lord Voldemort."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Then I need to send a message to Arthur,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Excellent,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Minerva,"" said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, ""I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""He is here at my invitation,"" said Dumbledore, looking between them, ""as are you, Severus."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I will settle, in the short term,"" said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, ""for a lack of open hostility."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""That will do to be going on with,"" said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Severus,"" said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, ""you know what I must ask you to do."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Then good luck,"" said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""The end,"" said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, ""of another year."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,"" said Dumbledore, ""but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,"" he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, ""enjoying our feast with us."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,"" said Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Every guest in this Hall,"" said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, ""will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""An excellent point,"" said Professor Dumbledore."
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"  ""An 'air from ze 'ead of a veela,"" said Fleur."

Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Fleur," ""Good-bye, 'Arry,"" said Fleur, turning to go."
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Frank,"  ""I don't know what you mean by wizard,"" said Frank, his voice growing steadier."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""We'll get it,"" said Fred at once."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Coming,"" said Fred."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee ""Yeah,"" said Harry, straightening up."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Ton-Tongue Toffee,"" said Fred brightly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""I didn't give him anything,"" said Fred, with another evil grin."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,"" said Fred."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Charlie had to take the test twice,"" said Fred, grinning."

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Oh shut up, Weatherby,"" said Fred."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Don't worry, Dad,"" said Fred gleefully, ""we've got big plans for this money."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""C'mon,"" said Fred, grabbing Ginny's hand and starting to pull her toward the wood."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Homework,"" said Fred vaguely."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Now, Mum,"" said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""They're not stopping me entering,"" said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Dunno,"" said Fred, ""but it's them we'll have to fool."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Yeah,"" said Fred airily, ""but that was years ago, wasn't it?"

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Easy,"" said Fred, ""concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Because George wants to invite him to the ball,"" said Fred sarcastically."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Nose out, Ron, or I'll burn that for you too,"" said Fred, waving his wand threateningly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,"" said Fred."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Angelina,"" said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Good point,"" said Fred."

Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Yeah, we'll come too,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Percy only passed two weeks ago,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""You've been ages,"" said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys' tents."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Cheers,"" said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Yeah, we've left it a bit late,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Balderdash,"" said George, ""a prefect downstairs told me."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Beyond cool,"" said George, sitting down opposite Fred."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Knows what it's like to be out there doing it,"" said George impressively."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""He's seen it all,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Having a nosy git like you for a brother,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn't telling,"" said George bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""No, of course not,"" said Hermione curtly, ""I hardly think students are supposed to -""  ""Well, we have,"" said George, indicating Fred, ""loads of times, to nick food."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Speak for yourself,"" said George shortly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""One drop each,"" said George, rubbing his hands together with glee."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Don't be a prat, Neville, that's illegal,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Looking for you,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""We're supposed to take you down to her office,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Told you, I was joking,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Interesting effect,"" said George, looking down at Crabbe."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Odd,"" said George lightly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Oh,"" said George darkly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""We've given up,"" said George, shrugging."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"""Are you saying he was involved in -""  ""Nah,"" said George gloomily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""So we asked for our money back,"" said George glowering."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George," ""Tell me about it,"" said George."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Nope,"" said George, shaking his head."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""You're mental,"" said George, trying to push it back at Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_George,"  ""Harry,"" said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, ""there's got to be a thousand Galleons in here."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny,"  ""We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,"" said Ginny."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny," ""Because he's being stupid,"" said Ginny, ""Its proper name is Pigwidgeon."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny,"  ""I like it,"" said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny," ""I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,"" said Ginny, looking surprised."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny," ""He - er - just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,"" said Ginny."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny," ""She's not,"" said Ginny quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny," ""I'm not telling you, it's her business,"" said Ginny."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ginny,"Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I'll just -""  ""I can't,"" said Ginny, and she went scarlet too."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Grubbly," ""He is indisposed,"" said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Grubbly," ""This way, please,"" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering."
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Ha,"She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, ""Ha!"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Hannah,"  ""Like poor Eloise Midgen,"" said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""She did put enough stamps on, then,"" said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs.  Weasley's was a mistake anyone could make."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""You've seen her,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Normal for us,"" said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, ""you know, owl post."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back -""  ""Only after Dudley finished with them,"" said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Well - yeah,"" said Harry, casually."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay then,"" said Harry brightly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Er,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I think so,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," I know,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""They - they've tried to get here by Floo powder,"" said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""It's upstairs,"" said Harry, grinning back."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yep,"" said Harry, ""that's Dudley."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""See you,"" said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee ""Yeah,"" said Harry, straightening up."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,"" said Harry earnestly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hi, Percy,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,"" he told Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, thanks a lot, "" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry softly, ""twice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, smiling, ""very good."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er - yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Let's go and have a look,"" said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield, where the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red - was fluttering in the breeze."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,"" Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Three pairs,"" said Harry firmly to the wizard."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, I am,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Dobby was weirder,"" said Harry fervently."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"right,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""maybe."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Bet she didn't ask permission to hide,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,"" said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I didn't drop it there, anyway,"" said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath  the skull."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry, shaking his head."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""Sorry,"" said Harry quickly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Mrs. Weasley,"" said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, ""Hedwig hasn't arrived with a letter for me, has she?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""You weren't there,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I told Sirius about my scar,"" said Harry, shrugging."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I hoped he'd get back to me quickly,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, I know,"" said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,"" said Harry suddenly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"if you say so,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Don't remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,"" said Harry coolly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hi, Colin,"" said Harry warily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er - good,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er - yeah, all right,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""That's not the song it sang when it Sorted us,"" said Harry, clapping along with everyone else."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry, ""I was born in July."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I've got two Neptunes here,"" said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, ""that can't be right, can it?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Get stuffed, Malfoy,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"said Harry - both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron's robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy - ""that expression she's got, like she's got dung under her nose?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Keep your fat mouth shut, then,"" said Harry, turning away."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry, ""missed."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""We had him this afternoon,"" he told Harry and Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry, almost defiantly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Right,"" said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Lose a treasured possession,"" said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"said Harry, scribbling it down, ""because..."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I'm going to bed,"" said Harry shortly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Diggory,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won't be able to handle them,""  said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Nope, they're upstairs in my bag,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah, have it,"" said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""They make them okay at Hogwarts,"" said Harry without thinking."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""There's a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,"" Dean told Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""We haven't been down to visit Hagrid yet,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hey, Ron,"" said Harry suddenly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Dunno,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry vehemently."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""The first task is designed to test your daring,"" he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, ""so we are not going to be telling you what it is."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I s'pose,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I didn't,"" said Harry, staring up at him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Balderdash,"" said Harry dully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line,"" said Harry slowly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Listen,"" said Harry, ""I didn't put my name in that goblet."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I dunno,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Good idea,"" said Harry gratefully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Great,"" said Harry bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"I brought some parchment and a quill out with me -""  ""Come off it,"" said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn't be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay, okay, I'll write to him,"" said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Wish I knew who did do it,"" said Harry bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""You just weren't concentrating properly -""  ""Wonder why that was,"" said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, really amazing,"" said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Great,"" said Harry dully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er -"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er -"" said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I didn't,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"yeah, nervous, I suppose,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"they say it's going to be a lot safer this year,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er,"" said Harry, yet again."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because - ""  ""I didn't enter,"" said Harry, starting to feel irritated."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Oh - right,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"They wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that WonkyFaint thing -""  ""Wronski Feint,"" said Harry, through gritted teeth."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry flatly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah, right,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No idea, ask Fred and George,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry slowly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""- you and the rest of the world,"" said Harry bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Looks hike a really good plan from where I'm standing,"" said Harry grinning bleaky."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell - dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon -""  ""Yeah, I know, I just saw,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Let's try some simple spellbooks, then,"" said Harry, throwing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Cedric,"" said Harry, ""the first task is dragons."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Dragons,"" said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Dead sure,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Never mind,"" said Harry quickly - he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I didn't cheat,"" said Harry sharply."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I haven't got any,"" said Harry, before he could stop himself."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Well, that's good,"" said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, ""just as long as it's not drawn-out."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, in a flat, distant voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"yes,"" said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, ""no - I - I know what I'm going to do, thanks."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No, I'm fine,"" said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"An' agains' the Horntail an' all, an' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors' - ""  ""Thanks, Hagrid,"" said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn't blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""And you,"" said Harry, grinning back."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, you can have a word,"" said Harry savagely."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"interesting,"" said Harry as she stepped on his foot."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry stoutly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I know what this is about,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hello, Winky,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Er - yeah, okay,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," "" 'Course you can,"" said Harry, and Dobby beamed."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""She was a foot taller than me,"" said Harry, still unnerved."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  "" 'Course she did,"" said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""She should've interviewed Snape,"" said Harry grimly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Cheers, Hagrid,"" said Harry, grinning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No one, yet,"" said Harry, feeling himself going red again."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""It's Christmas, Hermione,"" said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"okay,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Oh,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""That's okay,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, ""Well-""  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Oh right,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""She's part veela,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Thanks,"" said Harry, in relief."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, that would be great,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," Sirius ""He sounds exactly like Moody,"" said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away again inside his robes."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, okay,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  It's okay,"" said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""'Course you can,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"well, thanks, Dobby,"" said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Oh - yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,"" said Harry, grinning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hi,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Ron,"" said Harry quietly, ""I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum -""  But Ron ignored Harry too."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I do mind, though,"" said Harry hotly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Maybe she's got an Invisibility Cloak,"" said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""We've got to go and see him,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Fine, thanks,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, but he knew this couldn't be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well, thanks,"" said Harry, ""but I think I'm nearly there with the egg ."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""He offered to help me with the golden egg,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"nearly,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""He's not, I asked,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry and Ron together."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I wouldn't come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,"" said Harry furiously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hi, Hagrid,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Er-right,"" said Harry sheepishly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Great,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn't see anything but his head, ""I'm not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I'm honored,"" said Harry darkly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Good,"" said Harry vaguely."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"thanks,"" said Harry weakly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Map of Hogwarts,"" said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Positive,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry, taken aback."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er - no,"" said Harry, grinning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well, I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely doing it,""  said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he's on his second one,""  said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione's."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, I don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Dunno,"" said Harry dully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Bit,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I know what I should have done,"" said Harry, resting, face-down, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Or a frog,"" yawned Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Hermione, I was joking,"" said Harry wearily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""We'll meet you back in the common room,"" Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron - both of them looked very anxious."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Right,"" said Harry uneasily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Dobby,"" said Harry frantically, ""listen - are you sure about this?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well -"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""Yeah, that's right,"" said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he'd left all three girls tied to the statue."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I can't believe him,"" said Harry tensely, ""if he's caught."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Right,"" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry, with complete honesty this time."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,"" said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Hello, Sirius,"" said Harry when they had reached him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""They're making it sound like he's dying,"" said Harry slowly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,"" said Harry slowly, still reading the story."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,"" said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Right,"" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"Then he said, ""Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Loads of people,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No one,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""He's okay,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Says he's taken a liking to me,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Went to look in the bushes,"" said Harry, ""but there wasn't anyone else there."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Bagman told me they hadn't,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Hey, Winky,"" said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, ""you don't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""we haven't seen him since the first task."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""You'd better get up to the hospital wing,"" said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Maybe she had you bugged,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""That wouldn't be too bad,"" said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, all right,"" said Harry, slightly surprised."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry curiously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No, it's okay, Mr. Bagman,"" said Harry, suppressing a smile, ""I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""because were friends."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry very firmly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, ""if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the-""  ""I've done ."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Get up, Mr. Crouch,"" said Harry loudly and clearly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I'm a student at the school,"" said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""That's right,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I'll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Just stay with him,"" said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Just keep him here,"" said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Look,"" said Harry angrily, ""Crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he says he wants to warn -""  The stone wall behind Snape slid open."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Over here,"" said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er - yes,"" said Harry, staring at him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I don't think so,"" said Harry, shaking his head."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""He was out of his mind,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,"" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch,""  ""If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Sending a letter,"" said Harry and George in unison."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Well, he wasn't invisible,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No one's tried to attack me all year,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Look,"" said Harry impatiently, ""let's say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever -""  ""I don't want to see anything except a headache cure,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Okay,"" said Harry, staring at it, ""Pear Drop."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Er,"" said Harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well, I had a dream,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Er - that's all,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Right,"" said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes, Professor,"" said Harry, turning to go."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah,"" said Harry, ""but he's only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie,"" said Harry curiously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""There's no way she was there, there's no way she could've heard -""  ""The window was open,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Oh yeah,"" said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah, okay,"" said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the Great Hall."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I'm okay,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I don't know,"" said Harry slowly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""'The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,'"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Stop being noble,"" said Harry irritably."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""We're still square,"" said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Nope,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I will,"" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Dumbledore said stay,"" said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Cup was a Portkey,"" said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""He took stuff from his father's grave, and from Wormtail, and me,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Blood,"" said Harry, raising his arm."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""'Lo, Fawkes,"" said Harry quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""But -"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I don't want that gold,"" said Harry in an expressionless voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I told him to take the cup with me,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"he said gruffly ""Yeah,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""He'll never keep Rita quiet,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Get out,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Me,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry and Ron slowly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""No, I'm not,"" said Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Listen,"" said Harry firmly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, grinning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""He knows where he's sleeping,"" said Ron, ""in my room, he slept there last -""  ""We can all go,"" said Hermione pointedly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I think they've stopped arguing,"" said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""He looks really grumpy,"" said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Come here, Mr. Weasley,"" said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oooh, thanks, Harry,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Never mind, Ron,"" said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron's arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh come on,"" said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, ""let's go and find the others."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Beauxbatons,"" muttered Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""They must go to Beauxbatons,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I hope the others are okay,"" said Hermione after a while."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Those poor Muggles, though,"" said Hermione nervously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Over there,"" said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I told you, it's You-Know-Who's symbol, Ron,"" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"said Hermione slowly, ""were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Ron,"" said Hermione, in an I-don't-think-you're-being-very-sensitive sort of voice, ""Harry doesn't want to play Quidditch right now..."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, ""because he didn't pay Winky, did he?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,"" said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Yes,"" said Hermione sniffily, ""and it's got a horrible reputation."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets,""  said Hermione matter-of-factly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""But Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""It's bewitched,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Maybe,"" said Hermione, shrugging, ""or it might have Muggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,"" said Hermione thoughtfully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Either explain what you're on about or go away, Malfoy,"" said Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered ""Reparo!"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Of course he does,"" said Hermione quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oooh, I wouldn't fancy crossing the lake in this weather,"" said Hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh no, not necessarily,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Slave labor,"" said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"said Hermione) ""I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Come on,"" said Hermione, ""we'll be the only ones left here if you don't move."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I've decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,""  said Hermione haughtily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""They are now,"" said Hermione in an exasperated voice, ""but once Hagrid's found out what they eat, I expect they'll be six feet long."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""No,"" said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Got to,"" said Hermione thickly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No,"" said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I don't know,"" said Hermione, looking pensive."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You seem to be drowning twice,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Funny you should ask,"" said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Not spew,"" said Hermione impatiently."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well, of course you haven't,"" said Hermione briskly, ""I've only just started it."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Well - if you two join - three,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Our short-term aims,"" said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, ""are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""We start by recruiting members,"" said Hermione happily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""That was a lie, Harry,"" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""But - but you said it's illegal, Professor,"" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,""  said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,"" said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, ""because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""No, of course not,"" said Hermione curtly, ""I hardly think students are supposed to -""  ""Well, we have,"" said George, indicating Fred, ""loads of times, to nick food."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Hedwig'll attract too much attention,"" said Hermione at once."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I doubt it,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh don't say that,"" said Hermione with a shudder."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""For heaven's sake, Ron, he's only a Quidditch player,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's not that cold,"" said Hermione defensively."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Bouillabaisse,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's French,"" said Hermione, ""I had it on holiday summer before last."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""When you've both put your eyes back in,"" said Hermione briskly, ""you'll be able to see who's just arrived."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""But I don't think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,"" said Hermione, ""we just haven't learned enough."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I'm not sure this is going to work, you know,"" said Hermione warningly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well, I'm glad someone from Gryffindor's entering,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"not really,"" said Hermione awkwardly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Look,"" said Hermione patiently, ""it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""Maybe he'll believe I'm not enjoying myself once I've got my neck broken or -""  ""That's not funny,"" said Hermione quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"He'll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone's entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -""  ""He'd want you to tell him,"" said Hermione sternly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Harry, this isn't going to be kept quiet,"" said Hermione, very seriously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you're okay, and Buckbeak - Harry ""Finished,"" he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""People keep looking at me now,"" said Hermione grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""She's gone,"" said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Hello,"" said Hermione, smiling back."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""That doesn't matter,"" said Hermione firmly."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Nothing,"" said Hermione quickly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,"" said Hermione desperately."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh dear,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Winky,"" said Hermione firmly, ""I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Yes,"" said Hermione, ""he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,"" said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh she'll cheer up,"" said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department,"" said Hermione, ""and let's face it..."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I can't come with you,"" said Hermione, now blushing, ""because I'm already going with someone."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""But he's right, Harry,"" said Hermione, ""you have still got two tasks to do."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Yes, he did,"" said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""That was a really good lesson,"" said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,"" said Hermione quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Like you and Ron did, you mean,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""It's a lot colder where he comes from,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Those goblins didn't look very friendly,"" said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Ha, ha, ha,"" said Hermione sarcastically."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well, the/re quite capable of dealing with wizards,"" said Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Let's go,"" said Hermione, ""c'mon."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""We-er-we wanted to see Hagrid,"" said Hermione in a rather small voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"okay,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Come back and teach, Hagrid,"" said Hermione quietly, ""please come back, we really miss you."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh Ron,"" said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, ""we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry's life, remember?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You just want to think Snapes up to something,"" said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,"" said Hermione seriously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Weekend after next,"" whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harrys shoulder."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything,"" said Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch,"" said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""There's something funny, though,"" said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""It's more likely he did it than Winky,"" said Hermione stubbornly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Yes,"" said Hermione in a heated voice, ""he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled -""  ""Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's half past three,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,"" said Hermione severely."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh dear,"" said Hermione as she spotted Winky."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""But we're not sure if that's true,"" said Hermione quickly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""No, it's not that,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""You missed a really good lesson,"" Harry told Hermione as they headed back toward the castle."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,"" said Hermione brightly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It'll die down, though,"" he told Hermione, ""if we just ignore it."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"   It comes down to this,"" said Hermione, rubbing her forehead."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Just go through it again, Harry,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Well, that was his fault,"" said Hermione testily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""We need to see Professor Moody,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Yes, but this is the law"" said Hermione, looking scared."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"said Hermione eagerly, ""or because someone made him?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""No one's done anything to me at all-""  ""Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Harry, I don't understand it either,"" said Hermione desperately."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Well, I think Harry's got it now, anyway,"" said Hermione hastily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""Mind you, she's definitely got giant blood, and she doesn't want to admit it-""  ""Of course she doesn't,"" said Hermione sharply, looking up."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""He can't be,"" said Hermione, ""I've told you, those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""Nothing,"" said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Yes,"" said Hermione breathlessly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Hello,"" said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley's face."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"all right,"" said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh, Rita hasn't written anything at all since the third task,"" said Hermione in an oddly constrained voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn't supposed to be coming onto the grounds,"" said Hermione in a rush."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Bugging,"" said Hermione happily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""But you said they didn't work -""  ""Oh not electronic bugs,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh yes she is,"" said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No, I'm not,"" said Hermione, beaming."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Exactly,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""He was talking to her, in his hand,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I've told her I'll let her out when we get back to London,"" said Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Krum," ""You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,"" said Krum."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Krum," ""Don't vont to be overheard,"" said Krum shortly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Krum,"  ""Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,"" said Krum, looking suspiciously at Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Krum,"""I'll get Dumbledore, I'll be quicker, I know where his office is -""  ""He is mad,"" said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Krum," ""I liked Diggory,"" said Krum abruptly to Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Lee," ""He knows, man,"" said Lee."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Lee," ""Mazing,"" said Lee."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Lee,"  ""We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,""  said Lee, grinning broadly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Lee," ""Blimey, this is heavy,"" said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Lucius,"  Fudge, who wasn't listening, said, ""Lucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur."
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Macnair,"thank you,"" murmured Macnair."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Language, Weasley,"" said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"""Granger, they're after Muggles, ""said Malfoy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Have it your own way, Potter,"" said Malfoy, grinning maliciously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,"" sneered Malfoy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron's robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, ""Weasley, you weren't thinking of wearing these, were you?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Well, I can certainly see why we're trying to keep them alive,"" said Malfoy sarcastically."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Yes,"" said Malfoy resentfully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Oh he hasn't been attacked, Potter, if that's what you're thinking,"" said Malfoy softly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career,"" said Malfoy, his eyes glinting."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""So,"" said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Follow me, please,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""He could not have crossed the Age Line,"" said Professor McGonagall sharply."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""You're to go in here with the other champions,"" said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, ""and wait for your turn, Potter."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,"" said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - Ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before - ""I have something to say to you all."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Oh yes, you do,"" said Professor McGonagall irritably."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""It is traditional,"" said Professor McGonagall firmly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""But-I don't-""  ""You heard me, Potter,"" said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,"" said Professor McGonagall to the champions."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Good heavens,"" said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Of course,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Moody," ""Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology,"" Neville said."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle,"  ""You didn't used to care,"" said Myrtle miserably."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle,"  ""Sometimes,"" said Myrtle, rather slyly, ""but I've never come out to speak to anyone before."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle," ""You need to put your head under too,"" said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Myrtle,"  ""Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle's dead,"" said Myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Neville," ""Oh wow,"" said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Neville," ""There's one - the Cruciatus Curse,"" said Neville in a small but distinct voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Neville," ""Oh yes,"" said Neville, ""I'm fine, thanks."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Padma," ""Hi,"" said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Padma," ""But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,"" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Pansy," ""We'll explain later,"" Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Parvati," ""Wait here,"" he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said, ""Parvati?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Parvati,"  ""She's going with Seamus,"" said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Parvati,"said Parvati slowly, ""I suppose my sister might."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Oh hello, Harry,"" said Percy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,"" said Percy smugly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""Very badly,"" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course,"" said Percy dismissively, ""but how he ever got to be Head of Department ..."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""Oh Bertha's hopeless, all right,"" said Percy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Well, I certainly don't,"" said Percy sanctimoniously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Just Apparated, Dad,"" said Percy loudly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""It's classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,""  said Percy stiffly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Mr. Crouch's elf"" said Percy, sounding thunderstruck."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""I'll come with you, Father,"" said Percy importantly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Complaining about security at the World Cup,"" said Percy."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,"" said Percy swiftly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""Oh I'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,"" said Percy importantly, ""but in the meantime, I'm more than willing to take up the slack."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Potter,"Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, ""Potter, the champions and their partners -""  ""What partners?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Potter,"Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, ""Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita,"  ""Maybe not that small, Ludo,"" said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita," ""Lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry's upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita," ""Come along, dear - that's right - lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita,"The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:  Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, who's savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations - ""Lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita,"Even though he wasn't speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence:  An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes -- ""Ignore the quill, Harry,"" said Rita Skeeter firmly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita,"  ""Er - yes, let's do those first,"" said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita," ""Lovely,"" said Rita."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Rita,"Even Ludo Bagman -""  ""Sit down, you silly little girl, and don't talk about things you don't understand,"" said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""See you,"" said Ron brightly to the Dursleys."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He knows where he's sleeping,"" said Ron, ""in my room, he slept there last -""  ""We can all go,"" said Hermione pointedly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh,"" said Ron, cottoning on."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's room,"" said Ron quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Only, most of the stuff - well, all of it, really - was a bit dangerous,"" said Ron, ""and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""We're not thundering, ""said Ron irritably."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year -""  ""That'll change the world, that report will,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You might sneer, Ron,"" he said heatedly, ""but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger -""  ""Yeah, yeah, all right,"" said Ron, and he started off upstairs again."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Shut up, Pig,"" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all,"" said Ron sarcastically."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, all right,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""There's a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,"" said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""But we've got an oven,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Krum,"" said Ron quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""'Spect they go to some foreign school,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Met a few people,"" said Ron, setting the water down."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Wish I hadn't bought this now,"" said Ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No - don't bother,"" said Ron, going red."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Fair enough,"" said Ron, grinning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Fred and George can't have gone that far,"" said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione's, and squinting up the path."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Maybe it's back in the tent,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Well - there's a sort of riot going on,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He was a great Beater, though,"" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""They'll be fine,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That'd wipe the smirk off old Draco's face, all right,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""They will,"" said Ron reassuringly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, it was a human voice,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Well, she's not,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""We lost them in the dark,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I don't get it,"" said Ron, frowning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"think I will too,"" said Ron at once."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It was only a dream,"" said Ron bracingly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Bung him some Owl Treats,"" said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Nah, it would've been in the Daily Prophet,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Mum, you've given me Ginny's new dress,"" said Ron, handing it out to her."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You've got to be kidding,"" said Ron in disbelief."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I'll go starkers before I put that on,"" said Ron stubbornly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I think I've heard of it,"" said Ron vaguely."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Come off it,"" said Ron, starting to laugh."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Just you, then,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Ah, think of the possibilities,"" said Ron dreamily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It was,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We saw him right up close, as well,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Blimey,"" said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, ""if that keeps up the lake's going to overflow."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Sings a different one every year,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""About time,"" said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Aaah, 'at's be'er,"" said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,"" said Ron darkly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh c'mon, 'Er-my-knee,"" said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Must be,"" said Ron in a low, awed voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah,"" said Ron, a faraway look on his face."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Dumbledore knows you're not of age, though,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Shut it, you,"" said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"outside all morning,"" said Ron, who was running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You're eating again, I notice,"" said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"and you were hungry,"" said Ron, grinning."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Well, at least the skrewts are small,"" said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Aaaaah,"" said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney's mystical whisper, ""when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Miserable old bat,"" said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Well, bully for Professor Vector,"" said Ron moodily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,"" said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, ""you're ruining the best moment of my life!"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,"" said Ron, his eyes misting over, ""and bounced him all around his dungeon..."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Er,"" said Ron tentatively, ""my dad told me about one.."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, probably,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You know,"" said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, ""I think it's back to the old Divination standby."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah,"" said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, you will be,"" said Ron darkly, ""we're seeing the skrewts again on Monday."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Good one,"" said Ron, copying it down."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's just an expression,"" said Ron hastily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Never heard of it,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Hermione - open your ears,"" said Ron loudly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Drop it,"" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, I know,"" said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You only like him because he's handsome,"" said Ron scathingly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Nearly six,"" said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Maybe they've escaped,"" said Ron hopefully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I'm getting his autograph if I can,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Too late,"" said Ron bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, that's right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,"" said Ron scathingly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Bless you,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I'll take your word for it,"" said Ron, helping himself to black pudding."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, I'll just bet they are,"" said Ron quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Okay,"" said Ron, ""just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh good, hurry up,"" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Well, that's lucky,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,""" said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh hello,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"no one else got across the Age Line,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh right,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, okay,"" said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You've had an owl,"" said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Sorry about that,"" said Ron, his face reddening with anger."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""No,"" said Ron, ""I shouldn't've -""  ""Forget it, ""Harry said."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Barking mad,"" said Ron, shaking his head."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Hagrids been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledores never sacked him,"" said Ron consolingly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You'd be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,"" said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"he said happily, pointing at his bare chest, ""Tell you what, Dobby,"" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, ""I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""She seems to love him,"" said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake)."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She was quite good-looking,"" said Ron fairly, after he'd stopped laughing."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""She wants a new angle, Hagrid,"" said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Leave him alone, Hermione, he's earned a bit of a break,"" said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No, he's off delivering a letter,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Nope,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Well - you know,"" said Ron, shrugging."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Her nose is off-center,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Er - yeah, that sounds about right,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Harry - we've just got to grit our teeth and do it,"" said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""This is mad,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Thanks a bunch, Ginny,"" said Ron sourly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She's lying,"" said Ron flatly, watching her go."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Right,"" said Ron, who looked extremely put out, ""this is getting stupid."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Hermione,"" said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, ""your teeth ..."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless -""  ""They're only socks,"" said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Animal magnetism,"" said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Right,"" said Ron, looking around."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Hi,"" said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""If you don't know,"" said Ron scathingly, ""I'm not going to tell you."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, well - that's his story,"" said Ron nastily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You've got a funny way of showing it,"" sneered Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No,"" said Ron, still glaring after Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No idea,"" said Ron mulishly, looking up at him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I'll explain inside,"" said Ron quietly, ""c'mon. ."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"no one who knows him will care, 'cos they'll know he's not dangerous,"" said Ron slowly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, but there's still the giant squid,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Er - okay,"" said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Maybe Percys poisoning him,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Uh-oh,"" said Ron, staring at the door."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She'll be after you next, Hermione,"" said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,"" said Ron nervously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, he is,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn't have given them jobs, so why shouldn't he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit -""  ""- evil,"" said Ron promptly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You just don't like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,"" said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""They have,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Harry, you prat,"" said Ron, ""you didn't take that song thing seriously, did you?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, ""And you too-you 'elped -""  ""Yeah,"" said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, ""yeah, a bit -""  Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Come off it,"" said Ron incredulously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Told you,"" said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, ""told you she's obsessed with house -""  But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""That's what my dad said at the World Cup,"" said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape -""  ""Oh give it a rest, Hermione,"" said Ron impatiently."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I can try,"" said Ron doubtfully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""I don't know,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Poor old Snuffles,"" said Ron, breathing deeply."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Good idea,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Percy won't've had time to answer yet,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""She had to go to the hospital wing,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""No,"" said Ron shortly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's rubbish,"" said Ron, still glaring down at his potato."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah,"" said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It must've been Crouch,"" said Ron at once."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"hows this for a theory,"" said Ron excitedly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,"" said Ron, ""because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -""  ""Shh!"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Didn't sound like that,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"Can't see why you would, but -""  ""It's my business if you're blackmailing someone,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"said Ron slowly, ""I dunno if they would."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It's this joke shop idea they've got,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""So,"" said Ron, ""d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""said Ron angrily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's going to be boiling in Trelawney's room, she never puts out that fire,"" said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Good training for when we're all Aurors,"" said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Come and look at this,"" said Ron, who was standing by the window."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""No,"" said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No,"" said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Dunno,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"okay,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She said Dumbledore's got his reasons,"" said Ron, shaking his head darkly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It's very good already,"" said Ron in a strangled sort of voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You're kidding,"" said Ron."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"Harry,"" said Ron, clapping him on the back."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Seamus,"  ""First pus and now this,"" muttered Seamus."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Seamus,"  ""And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,"" said Seamus contemptuously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""I told Sirius about my scar,"" said Harry, shrugging."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, ""Sirius - how're you doing?"""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Karkaroff,"" said Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,"" said Sirius bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""We know he's a good actor,"" said Sirius, ""because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn't he?"
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,"" said Sirius grimly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""I don't know,"" said Sirius slowly, ""I just don't know..."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""Right - these dragons,"" said Sirius, speaking very quickly now."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""But you can do it alone,"" said Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Thanks,"" said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Fulfilling my duty as godfather,"" said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an Animagus,"" said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""My brothers Crouch's personal assistant,"" Ron informed Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""It's possible,"" said Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""The elf wasn't the only one in that box,"" said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,"" said Sirius, still pacing."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Hmm,"" said Sirius, looking thoughtful."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,"" Hermione told Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""No, I'm not,"" said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,"" said Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Yep,"" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""No idea,"" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""That's right,"" said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""No,"" said Sirius dully."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""He wasn't the only one,"" said Sirius bitterly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,"" Harry told Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him,"" said Sirius, nodding."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all,"" said Sirius."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""I think they've both got a point,"" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Well,"" said Sirius slowly, ""I wouldn't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"  ""And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you're at it,"" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius," ""Yes, he's quoted in the article in there,"" said Sirius, nodding at the paper."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"""I'll walk to the edge of the village with you,"" said Sirius, ""see if I can scrounge another paper."""
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Book_Sirius,"Harry,"" said Sirius, turning to him."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""It's no one's fault but Potter's, Karkaroff,"" said Snape softly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,"" said Snape coldly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""We re walking,"" Ron told Snape shortly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""It is unimportant,"" said Snape coldly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""A student, I daresay,"" said Snape."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"Dumbledore told me to keep an eye -""  ""Dumbledore happens to trust me,"" said Snape through clenched teeth."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""I merely thought,"" said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, ""that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ..."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"How very touching,"" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"Potter,""  said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""It is Veritaserum - a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,"" said Snape viciously."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Enter,"" said Snape in his usual voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"Potter,"" said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.-""  When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight's events,"" said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""There,"" said Snape harshly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""I am,"" said Snape."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout," ""Pus, Finnigan, pus,"" said Professor Sprout, ""and it's extremely valuable, so don't waste it."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout," ""This'll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,"" said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout,"  ""Silly girl,"" said Professor Sprout, shaking her head."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Book_Sprout," ""Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology,"" Neville said."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn,"" said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney,"  ""It is Uranus, my dear,"" said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""Yes,"" said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, ""it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""My dears,"" said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, ""we have almost finished our work on planetary divination."
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""This just arrived,"" said Uncle Vernon."
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Book_Uncle,"  ""Well, they most certainly won't be,"" said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort,"  ""Hold out your arm,"" said Voldemort lazily."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""Welcome, Death Eaters,"" said Voldemort quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""And I answer myself,"" whispered Voldemort, ""they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""Get up, Avery,"" said Voldemort softly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort,"  ""Yet you helped return me to my body,"" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,"" said Voldemort."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""The Lestranges should stand here,"" said Voldemort quietly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort,"  ""The same goes for you, Nott,"" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure  in Mr. Goyles shadow."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful -""  ""That will do,"" said Voldemort."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""Yes,"" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort,"  ""Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,"" said Voldemort."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,"" said Voldemort."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort,"Harry,"" said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""Very good,"" said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""A little break,"" said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, ""a little pause ."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Voldemort," ""I asked you whether you want me to do that again,"" said Voldemort softly."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Wormtail,"  ""My Lord, it makes sense,"" said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Wormtail,"By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us --""  ""I am a faithful servant,"" said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Wormtail,"  ""I found you,"" said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now."
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Book_Wormtail,"  ""Yes, Master,"" moaned Wormtail, ""please."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Bill,"  ""That's already Harry's, idiot,"" said Bill."

Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Dobby,"said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper."""
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Dobby,"   ""Harry Potter, sir,"" squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, ""the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection."

Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Draco,"  ""If you're wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,"" said Draco Malfoy."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,"" said Dumbledore pleasantly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"It is a long time since my last visit,"" said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Ah, good evening Harry,"" said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Albus Dumbledore,"" said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Yes,"" said Dumbledore simply, ""I shall."""

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Madam Rosmertas finest oak-matured mead,"" said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Well, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, turning toward him, ""a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"That is generous,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Well,"" said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, ""Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of 'Black.'"

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I think that will do, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Oh, she survived,"" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""That's right,"" said Dumbledore, smiling in approval."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Voldemort's grandfather, yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""It does,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Very good indeed,"" said Dumbledore, beaming."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""I think you are forgetting,"" said Dumbledore, ""that Merope was a witch."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes, indeed,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Again, this is guesswork,"" said Dumbledore, ""but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I think that will do for tonight, Harry,"" said Dumbledore after a moment or two."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Very important, I think,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""No, I acquired it very recently,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes, thank you, Phineas,"" said Dumbledore quellingly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I would rather not say just now,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes, I expect so,"" said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,"" said Dumbledore, frowning a little."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""She told me of your suspicions, yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie's accident,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,"" said Dumbledore, ""who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Ah,"" said Dumbledore, ""perhaps she could."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""No,"" said Harry quickly, ""but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother ?quot; ""Your mother had a choice too,"" said Dumbledore gently."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""This time,"" said Dumbledore, ""we are going to enter my memory."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""There I am,"" said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Good afternoon,"" said Dumbledore, holding out his hand."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""No, I am a teacher,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""It is called Hogwarts,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Here,"" said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, ""I think this will make everything clear."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Thank you very much,"" said Dumbledore, beaming."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Definitely,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Nothing,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I shouldn't think so, no,"" said Dumbledore quietly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Very much,"" said Dumbledore, rising too."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""No, no,"" said Dumbledore, smiling."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I am not from the asylum,"" said Dumbledore patiently."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""That's right,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Well, you were quite right,"" said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""All in good time,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Open the door,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Take it out,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Open it,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""You will return them to their owners with your apologies,"" said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""That is easily remedied,"" said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon, ""In Diagon Alley,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I'm afraid I don't know,"" said Dumbledore, his voice gentle."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""It is unusual,"" said Dumbledore, after a moment's hesitation, ""but not unheard of."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Sit down,"" said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"special,'"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Time is making fools of us again,"" said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""No,"" sighed Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""It was in the Daily Prophet""' ""The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,"" said Dumbledore, ""if only accidentally."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes, he is very nosy about that,"" said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,"" said Dumbledore, a little sharply."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,"" said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Well, you are quite right, because it is not,"" said Dumbledore briskly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""So,"" said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, ""we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,""" ""Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,"" said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,"" said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""That's right,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Never,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,"" said Dumbledore, ""and why should anybody delve further into Morfin's mind when he had already confessed to the crime?"
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,"" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I agree,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""This will not take long,"" said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Well, that's that,"" said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""As you might have noticed,"" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, ""that memory has been tampered with."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Certainly,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas,"" replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Enter,"" called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""My dear Sybill,"" said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, ""there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said ""   ""Very well,"" said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Please close the door and sit down, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""No,"" said Dumbledore, ""Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""I see,"" said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Thank you for saying that, Harry,"" said Dumbledore quietly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Then we shall say no more about it just now,"" said Dumbledore more kindly, ""but continue with our story where we left off."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Very good,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""But now, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, ""now things become murkier and stranger."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Deeply uneasy,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Well, quite,"" said Dumbledore, with a faint smile."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Time to leave, Harry,"" said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore's office."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,"" said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""I see we are of one mind,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes, that is my conclusion too,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. ""Precisely,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Now,"" said Dumbledore, ""if you don't mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""It had belonged to another of Hogwartss founders,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Mine,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Good evening, Tom,"" said Dumbledore easily."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""I am glad you approve,"" said Dumbledore, smiling."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""These days, 1 am known as ""   ""I know what you are known as,"" said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Well,"" said Dumbledore, still smiling, ""to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I merely wondered why you  who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister ""   ""Three times at the last count, actually,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,"" suggested Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,"" said Dumbledore lightly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""If you do not want to give me a job ""   ""Of course I don't,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""It is,"" said Dumbledore, also standing."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""No, nothing,"" said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""I have ideas,"" said Dumbledore, ""but no more than that."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Once the girl was out of earshot he said, ""Dumbledore said we wouldn't be having any more lessons until I got the memory!"""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Enter,"" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Good gracious, Harry,"" said Dumbledore in surprise."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""And now,"" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Thank you, Harry,"" said Dumbledore quietly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,"" said Dumbledore at last."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Well, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, ""I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"or more,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""You handed it to me, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Quite correct,"" said Dumbledore, nodding."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""But they could be anywhere in the world  hidden  buried or invisible ""   ""I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,"" said Dumbledore calmly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Yes indeed,"" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""I can only guess,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore, smiling, ""I would be prepared to bet  perhaps not my other hand  but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""My thoughts precisely,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""I don't think so,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Well, it is inadvisable to do so,"" said Dumbledore, ""because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Correct,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Oh yes,"" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes, I think so,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Yes, you have,"" said Dumbledore firmly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"   ""Yes, Harry, you can love,"" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"  ""Yes  just love,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Not here, precisely,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Lumos,"" said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes, this is the place,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""It has known magic,"" said Dumbledore simply."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,"" said Dumbledore after a moment or two."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I rather think,"" said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, ""that we are required to make payment to pass."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I said it was crude,"" said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,"" said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""You are very kind, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy's wound, ""But your blood is worth more than mine."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""After me, I think,"" said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Let us walk,"" said Dumbledore quietly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Oh yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Certainly we could,"" said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""What the things are, you mean,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Aha,"" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Oho,"" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Magic always leaves traces,"" said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, ""sometimes very distinctive traces."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes, I am sure you did,"" said Dumbledore calmly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Yes,"" said Dumbledore placidly, ""but we do not need to worry about them at the moment."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Nearly there,"" said Dumbledore cheerfully."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Careful not to touch the water,"" said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""I am not sure,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I cannot touch,"" said Dumbledore, smiling faintly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Out of the way, please, Harry,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,"" said Dumbledore easily."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""You remember,"" said Dumbledore, ""the condition on which I brought you with me?"""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""Yes,"" said Harry, ""but "" ""Well, then,"" said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, ""you have my orders."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,"" said Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Its all right, I'm here "" ""Make it stop, make it stop,"" moaned Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Sir,"" panted Harry, ""sir, I forgot  about fire  they were coming at me and I panicked "" ""Quite understandable,"" murmured Dumbledore."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"When he could stand it no longer he said, ""Professor Dumbledore, I'm really sorry."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"""Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,"" said Professor McGonagall kindly, ""and so do I.""""Well, I'm stayin,"" said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard."
Half_Blood_Prince,Hufflepuff,Book_Ernie,"""Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,"" said Ernie Macmillan , pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk."
Half_Blood_Prince,Hufflepuff,Book_Ernie,"   ""That sounds good, sir,"" said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together."
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Felix,"""You added Felix Felicis to Rons juice this morning, that's why he saved everything!"
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"""Eet was no trouble,"" said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harry's knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn."
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"No, no, silly boy,"" said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, ""I mean next summer, when we ?"
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"said Fleur, smiling serenely."""
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"At Beauxbatons,"" said Fleur complacently, ""we 'ad a different way of doing things."
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"Au revoir, 'Any,"" said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye."
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"""'Ow 'orrible,"" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder."
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"""You are as bad as zat Tonks,"" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks."
Half_Blood_Prince,No Entry,Book_Fleur,"""Thank you,"" said Fleur stiffly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Ravenclaw,Book_Flitwick,"""Now, now, boys,"" squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully."
Half_Blood_Prince,Ravenclaw,Book_Flitwick,"for homework,"" said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, ""practice."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Ravenclaw,Book_Flitwick,"""He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -"" She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled."
Half_Blood_Prince,Ravenclaw,Book_Flitwick,"""We must consult the governors,"" said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape's office."
Half_Blood_Prince,Ravenclaw,Book_Flitwick,"Hogwarts should be Dumbledore's final resting place,"" said Professor Flitwick."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Ravenclaw,Book_Flitwick,"""Well said,"" squeaked Professor Flitwick."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"""Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Oh blimey, I forgot about those,"" said Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""Just dab it on, that bruise'll be gone within the hour,"" said Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  '""Course it is,"" said Fred bracingly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""We've just developed this more serious line,"" said Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"   ""And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,"" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""You don't pay here,"" said Fred firmly, waving away Harry's gold."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"  ""There you go,"" said Fred proudly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"   ""Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,"" said Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"   ""That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,"" said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"""You wait, when I'm seventeen "" ""I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,"" yawned Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""What a snappy retort,"" said Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"- ""Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;|/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny "" "" that'll make Ginny's Christmas "" muttered Fred."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""Or he's the world's biggest prat,"" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred," ""No, I don't think we can do that,"" said Fred seriously."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,"" said Fred."""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"We were thinking of buying Zonko's,"" said Fred gloomily."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"""No idea,"" said Fred, frowning."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"""I dunno,"" said Fred, ""but there must be loads of people who'd like to poison Harry, mustn't there?"

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Fred,"Wood might've done the Slytherins if he could've got away with it,"" said Fred fairly.Well, I don't think it's Quidditch, but I think there's a connection between the attacks,"" said Hermione quietly""How d'you work that out?"""
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_George,"   ""You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm,"" said George."

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Its a bit odd,"" said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned."

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,"" said Hermione."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"   ""He  he just failed,"" whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"   ""I know,"" said Hermione soothingly, ""it does seem really harsh."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Ron, you're making it snow,"" said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Coward,"" said Hermione, though she looked amused."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""The Quidditch team,"" said Hermione."

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Katie," Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, ""Katie!"
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Katie," ""No,"" said Katie, shaking her head ruefully."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Katie,"""Well, I know I pushed open the door,"" said Katie, ""so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it."

Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"It's different,"" said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense."
Half_Blood_Prince,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"And I've told you a million times,"" said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, ""that I am too old for you, too poor ."

Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,"" said Malfoy quietly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"I can see Hogwarts,"" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window."
Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"   ""He always spoke very highly of you, sir,"" said Malfoy quickly."
Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"Yeah, I'm really going to tell you, because it's your business, Potter,"" sneered Malfoy."

Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"Your defenses,"" said Snape, a little louder, ""must therefore be as flexible and inventive as rhe arts you seek to undo."

Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""Late again, Potter,"" said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom."
Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""Before we start, I want your dementor essays,"" said Snape, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk."

Half_Blood_Prince,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"""Ah, Potter,"" said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""It's tonight,"" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I'll use the invisibility cloak,"" said Harry."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Nothing, Neville, nothing,"" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Keep playing,"" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,"" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""This way,"" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Probably,"" said Harry."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"Finally he said, ""Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --""  ""We're not offended,"" said Harry quickly."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Oh, I will,"" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,"" said Hermione."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,"" said Hermione in a sniffy voice."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Just one,"" said Hermione."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,"" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Hagrid,"" said Hermione, ""how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?"""
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,"" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's too late to change the plan now,"" Harry told Hermione."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --""  ""There's still Fluffy, though,"" said Hermione."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""That was far easier than I thought it would be,"" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Not if I can help it,"" said Hermione grimly."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No, no, no,"" said Hermione."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's the full Body-Bind,"" said Hermione miserably."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""We're coming,"" said Hermione."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"they can't be here just for decoration,"" said Hermione."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Yes,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,"" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ""but you can't pretend he's not careless."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Follow me, you two,"" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""Absolutely,"" said Professor McGonagall crisply."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, ""Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?"""
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,"" said Professor McGonagall."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""I'm disgusted,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Fifty points each,"" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""Must be,"" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Percy," ""You want to watch out for Peeves,"" said Percy, as they set off again."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"""Caput Draconis,"" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Percy,"  ""I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Really break your leg,"" said Ron."

Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You're losing it, too,"" said Ron."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yes, please,"" said Ron, but Harry cut him off."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""It's obvious,"" said Ron."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,"" Harry told Ron."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yes, but not to us,"" said Ron in exasperation."
Philosophers_Stone,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You'll understand later, Neville,"" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak."

Philosophers_Stone,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""That does it,"" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time."
Philosophers_Stone,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""I'll take them,"" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room."
Philosophers_Stone,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""I've already got us some rations,"" said Uncle Vernon, ""so all aboard!"""

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore," ""I do, Severus,"" said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Dumbledore,"I did express my concerns whet, you appointed --""  ""I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,"" said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn't reply."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, maybe,"" said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"""I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black --""  ""I know he's after me,"" said Harry wearily."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""'Course I haven't,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""He can't be getting in through a passage,"" said Harry quickly."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"Black's a madman, Harry, and he's dangerous --""  ""Malfoy's dad must have told him,"" said Harry, ignoring Ron."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Well,"" said Harry, feeling stunned, ""I'm betting it wasn't the Dursleys."""

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"said Harry, now starting to laugh himself ""Lupin?"

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I know,"" said Harry, ""but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --""  Wood went pale."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Oh -- yeah --"" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Ready,"" said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Okay,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,"" said Harry flatly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,"" said Harry dispiritedly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""You said it's harder if there are loads of them,"" said Harry."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Oddsbodikins,"" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I got it back,"" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, I suppose so,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Arithmancy looks terrible,"" said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah, that's true,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Here you go,"" said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Yeah, reckon so,"" said Harry casually."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Right,"" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once you'd yelled and woken people up,"" said Harry thoughtfully."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Hi, Neville,"" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""We're not -- meeting here,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"If Malfoy tells anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --"" ""See you later,"" said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""No,"" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I know that,"" said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""My dad didn't strut,"" said Harry, before he could stop himself."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,"" Wood told Harry constantly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yes,"" said Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""Yeah,"" said Harry, looking at his own watch."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""This way,"" said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned -  ""Get out of the way!"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""You killed my parents,"" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""I understand a lot better than you think,"" said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry,"  ""That's going to give us about sixty seconds,"" said Harry."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Harry," ""I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,"" said Harry, ""or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --""  ""Exactly!"

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Probably a stray,"" said Hermione calmly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Coincidence,"" said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""There you are, then,"" said Hermione in a superior tone."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,"" said Hermione coolly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid,"" said Hermione firmly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Stuck his head in the water barrel,"" said Hermione, putting the tankard away."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Please, sir,"" said Hermione, ""please, I could help Neville put it right --""  ""I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,"" said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You know how many subjects I'm taking,"" said Hermione breathlessly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh yes,"" said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""He seems like a very good teacher,"" said Hermione approvingly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"squealed Hermione; the whole common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top -  ""CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh, what rubbish,"" said Hermione impatiently."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh,"" said Hermione, ""I'm sorry, Lavender."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh,"" said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Well, look at it logically,"" said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group- ""I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he?"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,"" said Hermione, looking desperately sorry for him."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know,"" said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --""  ""Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"" said Hermione quickly, ""and we're just about to start --""  ""Be quiet,"" said Snape coldly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""But, sir,"" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, ""we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --""  ""Miss Granger,"" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, ""I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Please, sir,"" said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, ""the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, ""You asked us a question and she knows the answer!"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I don't know,"" said Hermione pensively."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"when you fell off, it got blown away,"" said Hermione hesitantly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Oh no,"" said Hermione, looking very disappointed."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Harry, listen,"" said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Harry, please,"" said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, ""Please be sensible."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,"" said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"You can call us as witnesses --""  ""I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,"" said Hermione thoughtfully, ""where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I don't know,"" said Hermione slowly, ""but it's a bit odd, isn't it?"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Nothing,"" said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her shoulder."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Fine,"" said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I suppose so,"" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,"" said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""N -- no,"" said Hermione in a trembling voice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Of course I did,"" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""No,"" said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,"" said Hermione, wiping her eyes."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""No,"" said Hermione shortly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""That's true,"" said Hermione, getting to her feet."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I'll do it, Hagrid,"" said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Yes,"" said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,"" said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""We'll have to hide in here,"" said Hermione, who looked very shaken."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""Okay,"" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,"" said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""So that's it,"" said Hermione quietly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Right, it's nearly time,"" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Oh, he's horrible,"" whispered Hermione, her ear to the door."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"""Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,"" said Hermione tensely."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""I know,"" sighed Hermione, ""but I can't stand another year like this one."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"  ""I promised I wouldn't tell anyone,"" said Hermione severely."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione,"I know how to use a fellytone now --""  ""A telephone, Ron,"" said Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Hermione," ""Harry,"" said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Katie," ""Strong and silent,"" said Katie, and they started to giggle again."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lily,"""I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me...."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""A dementor,"" said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Ah,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Water demon,"" said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Sit down,"" said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Professor McGonagall told me,"" said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Yes,"" said Lupin slowly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Well,"" said Lupin, frowning slightly, ""I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Clearly, I was wrong,"" said Lupin, still frowning at Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""I see,"" said Lupin thoughtfully."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Come in,"" called Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Ah, Severus,"" said Lupin, smiling."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I was just showing Harry my grindylow,"" said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Yes, Yes, I will,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I heard about the match,"" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, ""and I'm sorry about your broomstick."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""They're getting hungry,"" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""There are -- certain defenses one can use,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Ah yes,"" said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Another boggart,"" said Lupin, stripping off his cloak."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,"" said Lupin, ""which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Very good,"" said Lupin, smiling."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,""" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""I -- I did, as a matter of fact,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Not now,"" said Lupin firmly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"""Make them disappear --""  ""The true Patronus does do that,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I have complete confidence in you,"" said Lupin, smiling."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," I see,"" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""They call it the Dementor's Kiss,"" said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Oh no,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Professor, I --""  ""I don't want to hear explanations,"" said Lupin shortly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""You're wrong,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""He'll be delighted,"" said Lupin coolly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""But they already know,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Some of the staff thought so,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," I have not been helping Sirius,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt ""You're armed, we're not."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""The map,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Of course I know how to work it,"" said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,"" said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  I couldn't believe my eyes,"" said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry's interruption."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""No, Ron,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Everything,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --""  ""No, he's not,"" said Lupin quietly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,"" said Lupin, nodding."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"but you'll need to help me, Sirius,"" said Lupin, I only know how it began..."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""It's not,"" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Yes, indeed,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""A thought that still haunts me,"" said Lupin heavily."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""He's here, Sirius,"" said Lupin heavily."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --""  ""Severus, you're making a mistake,"" said Lupin urgently."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"a tame werewolf --""  ""You fool,"" said Lupin softly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I'm still not saying I believe you,"" he told Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Then it's time we offered you some proof,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,"" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""My God,"" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"He's been in my family for ages, right --""  ""Twelve years, in fact,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""No,"" said Lupin, ""Harry-""  ""And now you've come to finish him off!"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Harry,"" said Lupin hurriedly, ""don't you see?"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Enough of this,"" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Force him to show himself,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Well, hello, Peter,"" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""So we've heard,"" said Lupin, more coldly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things out,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"""You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --""  ""I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,"" said Lupin evenly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Certainly, Hermione,"" said Lupin courteously."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,"" said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Yes, I think so,"" said Lupin grimly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""You should have realized,"" said Lupin quietly, ""if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Very well,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I'm going to tie him up,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Right,"" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""There's nothing seriously wrong with him,"" said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""I'll do it,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""One wrong move, Peter,"" said Lupin threateningly ahead."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""I saw you coming,"" said Lupin, smiling."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""I'm afraid it is,"" said Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""And so we would have,"" said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Right then,"" said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Thank you, Dean,"" said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Inside, please,"" said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Now, then,"" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Nothing to worry about,"" said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Couldn't have put it better myself,"" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""This means,"" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's 'mall sputter of terror, ""that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""Precisely,"" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Good,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Right, Neville,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""didn't catch that, Neville, sorry,"" said Professor Lupin cheerfully."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""No, no, you misunderstand me,"" said Professor Lupin, now smiling."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Right then,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Neville, we're going to back away,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""On the count of three, Neville,"" said Professor Lupin, who was  pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --""  ""Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"" said Hermione quickly, ""and we're just about to start --""  ""Be quiet,"" said Snape coldly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""Lures travelers into bogs,"" said Professor Lupin as they took notes."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""It has nothing to do with weakness,"" said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin," ""You're expecting too much of yourself,"" said Professor Lupin, sternly in their fourth week of practice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Lupin,"  ""That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors,"" said Professor Lupin."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Macnair,"""I bet you anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot...."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""Well, look who it is,"" said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,"" said Malfoy."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""God, this place is going to the dogs,"" said Malfoy loudly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Yeah,"" said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned,"" said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy," ""I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer,"" said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Malfoy,"  ""Well,"" said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, ""partly, Potter."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Marge," ""And thirdly,"" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, ""we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""It was a dementor, Poppy,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and --""  ""Ah, of course,"" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost  ""Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"""If you said I could go --""  ""But I don't say so,"" said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an ""all-for-the-best"" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""I should think not,"" said Professor McGonagall sharply."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Precisely,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""Naturally,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,"" said Professor McGonagall darkly."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd better head back up to the castle,"" said Professor McGonagall."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""We'll risk it, Sibyll,"" said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall," ""That explains a great deal,"" said Professor McGonagall tartly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --""  ""Imagine that,"" said Professor McGonagall dryly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"  ""It will need to be checked for jinxes,"" said Professor McGonagall."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Mcgonagall,"""Honestly, Professor --""  ""You can't know that, Potter,"" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, ""not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with."

Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Potter," The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, ""Potter!"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Dad,"" said Ron simply."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Look at this,"" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --""  ""I haven't,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Dunno,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He was like that when Percy gave him to me,"" said Ron defensively."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Okay,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Wonder why,"" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""So's Scabbers's rat tonic,"" said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Go away, Ginny,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""well, I hope he's up to it,"" said Ron doubtfully."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,"" said Ron uncomfortably."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's coming from your trunk, Harry,"" said Ron, standing UP and reaching into the luggage rack."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,"" said Ron, sitting back down."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""I've read it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --""  ""Yeah, I think it is,"" said Ron in an offhand sort of way."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's this sweetshop,"" said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, ""where they've got everything..."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --""  ""-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you're sucking them,"" said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We must be nearly there,"" said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Great,"" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""No one screamed,"" said Ron, more nervously still."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you  ""I thought you were having a fit or something,"" said Ron, who still looked scared."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  I felt weird,"" said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No,"" said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Shove off, Malfoy,"" said Ron, whose jaw was clenched."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Malfoy,"" said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, we'll call you,"" muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, ""if we ever need someone mental."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""After you,"" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Right,"" said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,"" said Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," I thought that was a bowler hat,"" said Ron sheepishly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""They'd better not,"" said Ron, who wasn't eating either."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back,"" said Ron gloomily."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""None of your business,"" said Ron jerkily, without looking up."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Father's not very happy about my injury --""  ""Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury,"" snarled Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He's making it up,"" said Ron savagely."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She was right behind us,"" said Ron, frowning."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""First Hogsmeade weekend,"" said Ron, pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""Harry's supposed to stay in school-""  ""He can't be the only third year left behind,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Just keep him over there, that's all,"" said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You can copy mine, if you like,"" said Ron, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""He's hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, "" said Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"""- and she can't have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock --""  ""Don't mind Hermione, Lavender,"" said Ron loudly, ""she doesn't think other people's pets matter very much."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Go for it, Harry,"" said Ron stubbornly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""There's always the feast,"" said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP. ""You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, loads,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""There you go,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  I reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Probably,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"We heard him --""  ""Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Well, you know the Whomping Willow,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving off,"" said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"said Ron, looking very impressed, ""you've learned to Apparate!"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""He'd have a job spotting Harry in this,"" said Ron, nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That's the post office  ""Zonko's is up there --""  ""We could go up to the Shrieking Shack  ""Tell you what,"" said Ron, his teeth chattering, ""shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That's Madam Rosmerta,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Like trying to go after Black,"" said Ron sharply."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Because Black's not worth dying for,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Look,"" said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, ""it's the holidays!"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  I bet it was Dumbledore,"" said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""I know,"" said Ron, controlling himself, ""I know who it could've been -- Lupin!"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, but he likes you,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,"" said Ron happily."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,"" said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""He got a Firebolt for Christmas,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yes, you were,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She doesn't know,"" said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, all right,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Oh, shut up,"" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""No,"" said Ron flatly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's,"" said Ron dismissively."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh,"" said Ron, looking slightly put out."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,"" said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""It's my fault,"" said Ron abruptly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, it will,"" said Ron fiercely."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Oh -- well -- he was old,"" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""We're due in Charms,"" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,"" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Yeah, there's a burn on this table,"" said Ron, pointing."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,"" said Ron, but very quietly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Nope,"" said Ron in an offhand voice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That's convenient,"" snorted Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Rubbish,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""Buckbeak lost,"" said Ron weakly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Sunset, though,"" said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""We can't,"" said Ron, who was paper-white."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Come on,"" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""You're nutters, both of you,"" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""And me,"" said Ron savagely, limping forward."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it,"" said Ron grumpily."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron,"  ""Yeah, I've been thinking about them too,"" said Ron."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Ron," ""That's good enough for me,"" said Ron happily."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Seamus," ""Hey, Harry,"" said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass scales, ""have you heard?"
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Seamus," ""Not too far from here,"" said Seamus, who looked excited."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Gryffindor,Book_Seamus," ""He's a complete lunatic,"" said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Sir,"" Malfoy called, ""sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm --""  ""Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him,"" said Snape without looking up."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Now,"" said Snape in his most dangerous voice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig,"" said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"His potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --  ""Orange, Longbottom,"" said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Please, sir,"" said Hermione, ""please, I could help Neville put it right --""  ""I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,"" said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Everyone gather 'round,"" said Snape, his black eyes glittering, and watch what happens to Longbottom's toad."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Five points from Gryffindor,"" said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Fascinating,"" said Snape, without looking at it."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""Not at all,"" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't like."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,"" said Snape with a twisted smile."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --""  ""Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"" said Hermione quickly, ""and we're just about to start --""  ""Be quiet,"" said Snape coldly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Werewolves,"" said Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""But, sir,"" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, ""we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --""  ""Miss Granger,"" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, ""I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"The snout of the werewolf --""  ""That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,"" said Snape coolly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""D'you know what that --"" (he called Snape something that made Hermione say ""Ron!"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""Yes, Headmaster,"" said Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Come with me, Potter,"" said Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Sit,"" said Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,"" said Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"""It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --""  ""Malfoy is not having hallucinations,"" snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot apart."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""I certainly did,"" said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,"" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"""You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --""  ""Two more for Azkaban tonight,"" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,"" snarled Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape,"  ""Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,"" hissed Snape."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Slytherin,Book_Snape," ""Settle down, settle down,"" said Professor Snape idly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan,"  ""Yep,"" said Stan proudly, ""anywhere you like, long's it's on land."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan,"  ""Eleven Sickles,"" said Stan, ""but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, and for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of your choice."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""Take 'er away, Ern,"" said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie's."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,"" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan,"  ""Yep,"" said Stan, ""in front of witnesses an' all."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""Yeah,"" said Stan, still rubbing his chest."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""Laughed,"" said Stan."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""An' now 'e's out,"" said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black's gaunt face again."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""Right then, Neville,"" said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in London?"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Stan," ""Righto,"" said Stan."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Tom," ""Very smart owl you've got there, chuckled Tom."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""Welcome to Divination,"" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear,"" said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""I think we will leave the lesson here for today,"" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""Until we meet again,"" said Professor Trelawney faintly, ""fair fortune be yours."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,"" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway voice, ""and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,Ravenclaw,Book_Trelawney," ""I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,"" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle,"  ""No need to tell us he's no good,"" snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""When will they learn,"" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, ""that hanging's the only way to deal with these people?"""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""Secondly,"" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply, ""as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any -- any funny stuff while she's here."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""And thirdly,"" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, ""we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys."""
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""Well, Petunia,"" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, ""I'll be off to the station, then."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle,"  ""St. Brutus's,"" said Uncle Vernon promptly."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Uncle," ""He -- didn't work,"" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry."
Prisoner_Of_Azkaban,No Entry,Book_Yer," At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said, ""Yer right."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus," Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, No!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Okay. Then I get Fang!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, How many are there?
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, I don't care how big they are!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Make it move.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, MOVE!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, He's boring.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," Mum, mummy!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," Mum, help! Help me!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, I-I-I'm not Harry.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, {whimpers}
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Hagrid is bringing him.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, The only family he has.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Good luck...Harry Potter.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Let the feast...begin.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Fine. They're both just fine.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Filch," Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Filch," Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Filch," A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Filch," Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Filch," There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Firenze," Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Firenze," A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Firenze, Can you think of no one?
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Firenze, Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Firenze," Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Flint, Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Flint, {to other members} Take that side!
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Flitwick," One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then."
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Flitwick," Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Flitwick, Whooaaa! Ooh.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_George," He's not Fred, I am!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_George," Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_George, But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Griphook," Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Griphook, Vault 713.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Griphook, Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," You're a wizard, Harry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen Albus Dumbledore."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, If you know where to go.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," See, Harry, you're famous!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Shh!!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Hello, Harry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Well done!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Go go go!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Looks like he's gonna be sick!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Yes!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Oh.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, That? It's a ... its um...
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, dear."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Right. Let's go.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Yes! {grins}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yes, Aunt Petunia."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yes, Uncle Vernon."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, He's asleep!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Anytime.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {Grins and giggles}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ow!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Get off! Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, They're my letters! Let go of me!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads Happee Birdae Harry.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sorry, no."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Learnt what?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I-I'm a what?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Muggle?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {laughs}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {Nods} Okay.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Good-bye.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," What's in there, Hagrid?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I still need...a wand.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {Softly} Hello? Hello?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sorry, but what's curious?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, And...who owned that wand?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Wow.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Voldemort?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Excuse me, excuse me."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Muggles?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, not at all."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, The what?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, I got Dumbledore!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, he's gone!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Just a little bit.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yeah!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, Hagrid."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Wow.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What's he teach?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think she fancies you.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, We got lost.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I don't know, Sir."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I don't know, Sir."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Neville! {shouting}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Give it here, Malfoy."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," A century, according to McGonagall."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I-I didn't know.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Who doesn't?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What's happening?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {taps Ron} Let's go this way.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Let's go.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Run!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's locked!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Guarding something?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I like this ball.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What do I do with it?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whoa.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think she heard you.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Where's Hermione?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, How could a troll get in?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hermione! She doesn't know!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hermione, move!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Whoa, whoa whoa!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Do something! {swipe}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Anything! Hurry up!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm not hungry.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That explains the blood.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But I-I never get mail.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's a broomstick!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But who...?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, A little bit.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What happened?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yes!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whoa! Whooa!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yes?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Exactly.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Nicholas Flamel?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Knight to E-5.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I've got presents?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."""
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Some kind of...cloak.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, My body's gone!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm invisible??
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well."""
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Shh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hagrid!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Norbert?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Malfoy.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I don't understand. Is that bad?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, 50?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hagrid, what's that?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," What is it, Fang?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But who would choose such a life?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, The Philosopher's Stone.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, My scar. It keeps burning.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Not like this.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Someone's going to try and steal it.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Trevor.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Now, Neville, listen. We were"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, We have to move its paw.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hermione! Where are you?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Apparently not.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron, are you okay?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Okay.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I don't know. Strange.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's too simple.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Catch the key!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Where are we? A graveyard.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, There's the door.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Wait a minute.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, Ron! No!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, He's going to sacrifice himself!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Not as good as you.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Snape was trying to...save me?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Th-then you let the troll in.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Voldemort.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {shakes his head} Never!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You liar!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Admirers?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But, what happened to the Stone?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What is it?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," All right there, Ron?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {shrug} All right. Hermione?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, {Pats} Good job.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm not going home. Not really.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts A History."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Eugh.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Up. Up. Up. Up.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, {Gasps.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Filch is gone.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It was locked.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ahhh! Help!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Swish and flick!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Is it...dead?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Blood?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, So you're saying...
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Whoo-hoo!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, That thing has a name?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I don't know.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, That's totally barbaric!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, See you haven't.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It means you'll never die.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Is that...a dragon?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Harry!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It's happened before.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What is it?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, And with Dumbledore gone
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Uh...we were just...
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Now what do we do?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Sorry.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ow! You stood on my foot!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Alohomora.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, The harp. It stopped playing.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Are you okay?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," He's not relaxing, is he?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, We've got to do something!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What is that?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What's this all about?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," What's wrong, Harry?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Now what do we do?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What happens now?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What is it?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, {smile} Never better.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, We're tied with Slytherin!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Come on, Harry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch," Good afternoon, class."
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch," Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, With feeling!
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch," Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, Mr. Longbottom.
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, Mr. Longbottom!
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, Come back down this instant!
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch," Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up."
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch," Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch," Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Hooch, {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee," Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee, The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee," The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee, The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee, Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee, Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee, Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee, He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee," Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, And the boy?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, We're ready for you now.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Draco Malfoy.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Susan Bones.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Ronald Weasley.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Harry Potter.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," {dings on a cup} Your attention, please."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Ms. Granger?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, {Giggles happily}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Good evening.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, {shocked} How do you know
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Seamus, that picture's moving!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Oh...
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, AHH!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Help!!!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, AHH!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Help!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Owowowow.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Nick, Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Nick," Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Nick, I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Nick, Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Nick, Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oiiver," Scared, Harry?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver, That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave."
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious."
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy, Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy, Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, {Sees him} AHH!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, My darling boy! How did you get in there?!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, It's all right. It's all right.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, Ooh.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Petunia, We had to tell him something.
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry You wait here.} an essential in-gredient
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, Severus...I-I thought...
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, W-what do you m-mean?
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"""
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse."
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Come here, Potter, now!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, Tell me. What do you see?
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, What is it?! What do you see?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Master, you are not strong enough."
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the..."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {whispers} Scar...?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Wicked.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whoa!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I got about 6 of him.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, No.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whoaa!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Wicked.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Mental that one, I'm telling you."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Harry, what is it?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {Sighs}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Look at that one, Harry!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, That was bloody brilliant.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before..."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ah. Mail's here!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, It's Filch's cat!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," That's it, we're done for!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Alohomora?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Probably thinks this door's locked.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, She needs to sort out her priorities!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ew.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What? {swipe}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron Cool.) It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Let's open it.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Come on, Hermione!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Go!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Fluffy?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Queen to E-5.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, We've looked a hundred times!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Happy Christmas, Harry."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yeah!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What is it?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, let's see then. Put it on."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whoa!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Why?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I only see me.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, This is light?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Immortal?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I know what it means!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {laughs}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, It's bad.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {weakly} Okay.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Uh. It's got horrible breath!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Now what are we gonna do?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh! Harry!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Harry!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Help!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Help! Help me!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahhh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yeah.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, This complicates things a bit!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Hurry up!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Check.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahhhh!
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, All right? You?
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus, I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione Well done, dear.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus, Neville! {Shakes his hand.}
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snake, Thankssssssss.
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention."
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Tom, Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," Happy birthday, son."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Move!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, What happened?
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk."
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, No more mail through this letterbox.
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Shoo! Go on!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," Go away, ahh!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Give me that! Give me that letter!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Who's there? Ahh!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon," I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!"
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, He'll not be going!
Sorcerer_Stone,No Entry,Movie_Vernon, I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}"
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Kill him!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Fool! Get the stone!
Sorcerer_Stone,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Arrrhhhhhh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," Morning, Weasleys."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley, What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley, Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Rons told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley, Did you really? Howd it go? Did you
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," I meanthat was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," Dumbledore must know youre here, Harry. Doesnt miss a trick, that man."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley, Diaganilly.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," Children, its mad in here! Lets go outside."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley, Lucius.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley,1058! Come on! Come on!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," Fred, George, Percy you first!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," After you, dear."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia, Hes in there. Vernon
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia," Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia," in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia, Oh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Colin," Hi, Harry! (flash) Im Colin Creevy! Im in Gryffindor, too!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Colin," (flash) Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge," Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministrys got to act."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge," Albus look, Hagrids record is against him. Ive got to take him."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge," Im afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge," Come, Hagrid Well?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge, Good boy.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Crabbe," Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Crabbe, Its good right? Ah Cool!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Crabbe & Goyle, Ummmum.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dean Thomas, Ron? Is that your owl?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! Its just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," No, I havent. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Bad Dobby!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Baaad Dobby!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was hereooh But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Ooo er cant say argh...
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Dont make me talk, I Errr"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Bad Dobby.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Let me go!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Friends who dont even write to Harry Potter?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Harry Potter mustnt be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, No! Ahh! Ooh
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, (Snap!)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Harry Potter must say hes not going back to school!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potters own good. (Snap!)"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, (Snap!)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Hello!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Indeed. Yes, sir."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Uhuh Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Uh-huh-huh Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like verminuh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Ah! I shouldnt have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. HARRY No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, (Snap!)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Um-humm
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Ahh! Oow!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Master has given Dobby a sock!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dobby," Anything, sir!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Ill bet you loved that, didnt you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Cant even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Oh look, Potter. Youve got yourself a girlfriend."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Thats right. And thats not all that new this year.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Ha, ha!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Ha, ha"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Enemies of the heir beware! Youll be next, Mudbloods!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," All right there, Scarhead?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Training for the ballet, Potter?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Youll never catch me, Potter!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Uhh, uhhh"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Scared, Potter?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Everte statium!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Serpensortia!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Reading?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," I didnt know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Well, sit down. Youd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. Theyre an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. Whats wrong with you, Crabbe?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," You know, Im surprised that the Daily Prophet hasnt done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, What? You think theres someone here whos worse than Dumbledore?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Good one, Goyle. Youre absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that hes the Heir of Slytherin!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," You know I dont Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this Its been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldnt tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, its only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope its Granger. Whats the matter with you two? Youre acting veryodd."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Hey! Where are you going?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Whod want to be friends with you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Ill be waiting to open the door!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Dad! Whats going on?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dudley," Dad, hurry up!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, Dad!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, They are not.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Argus! Argus, I Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except you three."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Shes not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution to all."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Theres been another attack.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, It meansthat our students are in great danger.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Harry?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Oh, and about time, too. Hes been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Hagrid. HAGRID In fact, Id be prepared ter swear it in front o the Ministry of Magic!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Yes.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," No, Harry. I do not think it was you But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Very well, then. Off you go."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Riddle! Come.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Im afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I understand Tom, but Im afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Is there something you wish to tell me?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Very well, then. Off you go."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If Im not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Not intentionally, but yes."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Its true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," When the governors learned that Arthur Weasleys daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, I beg your pardon?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Oh, yes."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Voldemort.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemorts old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch," Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch," Whats going on ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are youMrs. Norris? Youvemurdered my cat."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch, Ill kill ya Ill kill ya!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch, Ask him. Its him whos done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch, Rubbish!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch, My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Filch," Caught in the act! Ill have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Come on.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Right.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," This lot wont come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," And not to mention, theyre dead scared that Harryll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_George," Go, go, go, go!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Right!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_George," Yeah, Mum would never know."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny, Leave him alone.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didnt mean to! Riddle made me, and Harry, youre hurt!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Haary, Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Harry?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, What do you think youre doing down ere? Come on!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don want no one ter see you there. Peoplell think you were up to no good."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Me? Oh, I was um I was lookin for Flesh-Eatin Slug Repellent. Theyre ruinin all the school cabbages."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Hello, Hermione!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Youll be all right now then, Harry? Right. Ill leave you to it, then."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Wo, this calls for a specialists equipment. Nothin to do but waitll it stops, Im afraid."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Better out than in. Whos Ron tryin to curse, anyway?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, He did not!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," See, the thing is, Harry, therere some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think theyre bettern everyone else because theyre what people call pure blood."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," And its codswallop, to boot. Dirty blood. Why, there isnt a wizard alive today thats not half blood or less. More ter the point, theyve yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can do. Come here Dont you think on it, Hermione. Dont you think on it for one minute eh?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Blimey! Harrys got himself a rogue Bludger! Thats been tampered with, that has!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Broken? Theres no bones left!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasnt Harry!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, of course you dont, and Oh Oh, right. Well, Ill, umhum. Ill just wait outside, then."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Lets get yeh out of there.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, You cant! You dont understand.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, It wasnt him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, No!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, No!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Aragog! Aragog!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Mad and hairy? You wouldnt be talking about me now, would ya?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, Its a- Flesh-Eatin Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin to Professor Sprout, theyve still got a bit o growing up to do. But, once their acnes cleared up, well be able to chop em up and stew em, and then well get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Hello, Neville!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Whos there? Hello? Hello?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah It doesnt matter- come on inI just made a pot o tea."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Im fine! Im alright.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," What you had to understand about that is (knock, knock, knock) Quick under the cloak. Dont say a word. Be quiet, both o you Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Of course! Come in! Come in.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Whatre you doin here? Get outta my house!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yeh can take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an the Muggle-borns won stand a chance! You mark my words, therell be killins next!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all theyd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! Thats all I have to say. Oh, and someonell need to feed Fang while Im away."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Sorry Im late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And Id just like to say that aif it hadnt been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o course, I woulduh- Id still be you-know-where, so I- Id just like to say Thanks."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Oh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Now youve done it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But shes bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But I havent had any messages from any of my friends not one all summer.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ill be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I dont exist."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Who are you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isnt a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why dont you sit down?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby, ssh! Im sorry! I didnt mean to offend you, or anything."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You cant have met many decent wizards then.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Stop, Dobby!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby, shh!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby, please stop!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Your family?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What terrible things? Whos plotting them?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ok I- understand. You cant- say.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Get in there, and keep quiet!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I- I was just
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sorry.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yes, sir See why Ive got to go back? I dont belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. Its the only place Ive got friends!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, I expect theyve been- hang on- how do you know my friends havent been writing to me?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Give me those, now!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby, get back here!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby, please, no!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I cant. Hogwarts is my home!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ahh- ahh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Let go of me!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Get off!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think its brilliant
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hello. W-what did I do?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Raids?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, sorry sir. Im Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, umm"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Floo powder?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Diaganilly.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Im fine, thank you. I- I was just"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No! Please!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hagrid!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I was lost, I hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, its great to see you, too!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I definitely need to remember that one.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Thank you. Bye.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Lets go.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Aah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why cant we get through?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, The train leaves at exactly eleven oclock. Weve missed it!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles arent accustomed to seeing a flying car."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well come on, then. Lets go lower. We need to find the train."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Do you hear that?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hold on
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Wha-aahhh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Im trying. Your hands all sweaty.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think we found the train.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Up! Up!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ahh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Be thankful its not your neck.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I dont know.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Come on! Go! Fast!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we cant get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree clearly someone doesnt want me here this year."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Youre doomed.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Stop! Stop! Hold still!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Malfoy?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, Colin! Get out of the way! Lets take him to Hagrids."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hell know what to do.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ah! Oh Okay.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Malfoy. He called Hermione, um, well, I dont- I dont know exactly what it means."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whats a Mudblood?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Thats horrible!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Not really.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That voice.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Didnt you hear it?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Spooky.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Did you hear it?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That voice.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I heard it first in Lockharts office. And then again just
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Its moving. I think its going to kill.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Strange. Ive never seen spiders act like that.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, no Its Filchs cat. Its Mrs. Norris."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No. No.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Its not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, When I said I wasnt hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Strange?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, maybe Rons right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, how long will it take to make?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Wood! Look out!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Thank you.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, I think my- I think my arms broken."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, not you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ugh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Uh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Dobby?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It was you You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Youd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I dont suppose you could tell me why youre trying to kill me?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Whos doing it now?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Thank you, sir."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You wish.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Rictusempra!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Im a what?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whats bad? If I hadnt told that snake not to attack Justin.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You were there! You heard me!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I spoke a different language? But- I didnt realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But Im not I cant be.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ill see you back in the common room.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you dont understand!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Professor I swear I didnt!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Professor Dumbledore?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I I-I was- I was just wondering if youd put me in the right house.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Youre wrong.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You dont think it was me, Professor?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, sir. Nothing."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Come on. Lets get em.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ughh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hermione, come out. Weve got loads to tell you!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hermione? A- are you OK?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls Whats this?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Looks like Moaning Myrtles flooded the bathroom.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why would I throw something at you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Tom Marvolo Riddle.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, My name is Harry Potter.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Can you tell me?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Excuse me. Could you tell me whats going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Dumbledore?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hagrid! Haagriid!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Woah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," W- whats that youve got, Hagrid?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, And they found it. Tom Riddles diary is gone.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Weve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I cant believe its him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, hell know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and thats a start."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think its time to get my Dads old cloak out again.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Whats that for?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hagrid, are you okay?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Did you hear about Hermione?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know whos opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You heard what Hagrid said; Follow the spiders.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Shush!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Come on!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Dont panic.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Were friends of Hagrids. And you? Y- y-youre Aragog arent you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hes in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think its Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Then youre not the monster.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Shush. But if youre not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But have you seen it?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," One, but its not powerful enough for all of them."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Lets go! Arania exumai! Go!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Arania exumai!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Dont mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Come on! Pull!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Wish you were here Hermione. We need you now, more than ever."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpents eye. Spiders flee before it. Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. Thats why I can hear it speak. Its a snake!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. JustinJustin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but hes a ghost- he couldnt die again. And Hermionehad the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisks reflection. Spiders flee before it. It all fits!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hermiones answered that, too."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Lockhart may be useless, but hes going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Youre running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You wrote them!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Dont even think about it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, To ask you how you died.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Who was it Myrtle?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hesha- Hassah.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, yes there is! You first."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, All right. Lets go.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Uhthanks Myrtle.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Its a snakeskin.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. Ill go on and find Ginny!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hesha- Hassah.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ginny Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please dont be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, she wont wake? Shes not?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Are you a ghost?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Shes cold as ice. Ginny, please dont be dead. Wake up! Youve got to help me, Tom. Theres a basilisk."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Give me my wand, Tom."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Listen, weve got to go! Weve got to save her!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No. She couldnt. She wouldnt!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But why?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But, why did you want to meet me?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hagrids my friend! And you framed him, didnt you?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ill bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, you havent finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You! Youre the Heir of Slytherin. Youre Voldemort.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hell never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ginny-
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ginny
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dont worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and youll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasnt quick enough Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! Its alright, Ginny. Its over. Its just a memory."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Its just You see, sir I- I couldnt help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Because I asked it to.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Godric Gryffindor.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Dont worry. I will be.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasleys cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Open it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Just promise me something.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Never try to save my life again.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldnt have done it without you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, theres no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ron!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Excellent.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hermione, are you okay?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Come on.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think the Slytherin common rooms this way.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Im
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ah- um Reading.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Uh-huh.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Youre wrong!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Harry Potter? (gulp)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But then you must have some idea whos behind it all.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Its his stomachache. Calm down.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hair!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I cant let you out, Hedwig. Im not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Harry! Hagrid!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Oh, its so good to see you!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ok! Bye!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Come on! Everyones been so worried.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. Its also quite dangerous. The Mandrakes cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Get off me!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Immobulus!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You okay, Ron? Say something!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, He called me a Mudblood.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It means dirty blood. Mudbloods a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. Its not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Harry!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Voice? What voice?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, The Chamber of Secrets has been opened enemies the heir beware. Its written in blood.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Thats why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. Wed just found him when he said"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Its a bit strange, isnt it?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. Its just strange."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isnt a good sign."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us aboutthe Chamber of Secrets?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Muggle-borns.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Yes. Couldnt you tell? McGonagalls worried. All the teachers are.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, If youre talking about Malfoy.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Even they arent that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, itll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion. (Reading from Moste Potente Potions) Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another. RON Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, well turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Yes.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Exactly. But its tricky. Ive never seen a more complicated potion.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, A month.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I know. But its the only plan weve got.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, No! Even with a proper wand its too risky. You could hit Harry!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Lets go.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Finite incantatem!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Are you okay?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You will be able to, wont you?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? RON Of course. Dont you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now hes taught Draco how to do it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Maybe. Well have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Heh No. No one ever comes in here.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Moaning Myrtle.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Moaning Myrtle.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Shes a little sensitive.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Do you think hes all right?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Oh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, You can talk to snakes.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No, they cant. Its not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," I dont know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. Theres a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Everythings set. We just need a bit of who youre changing into. HARRY Crabbe and Goyle.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle cant burst in on us while were interrogating Malfoy.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Ive got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once theyre asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ive already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode Slytherin- I got this off her robes. Im going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Well have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves Add the hairs.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Cheers!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Me too.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I- I dont think Im going. You go on without me!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Just go. Youre wasting time!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Go away!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cats hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrodes robes. Look at my face.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It cant be Hagrid. It just cant be.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Look. Hagrids our friend. Why dont we just go and ask him about it?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasnt a student.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Its good to be back! Congratulations! I cant believe you solved it!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Thanks.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Oh, no!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Justin Finch-Fletchley, What are you playing at?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee Jordan, Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Lee Jordan, Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his nameor very foolish."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," And you must be Miss Granger. Yes, Dracos told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, arent they? Let me seered hair vacant expressions tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope theyre paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, Id say not. Whats the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they dont even pay you well for it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Clearly. Associating with Muggles and I thought your family could sink no lower. Ill see you at work. DRACO See you at school.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Already here, Fudge? Good"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," The other governors and I have decided its time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. Youll find all twelve signatures on it. Im afraid we feel youve rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, therell be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, You think so?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Ill deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, its true-- you have returned!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Ridiculous!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, How dare you?!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, And? Who was it?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Ah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, I see.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. Were leaving."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Mine? I dont know what youre talking about.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," You do, do you? Why dont you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Dobby?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, What? I didnt give. DOBBY Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Youve lost me my servant!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Advada.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Madame Pomfrey, Oh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Madame Pomfrey," Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Shouldve been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Madame Pomfrey," Oh, Ill be able to, certainly. But itll be painful. Youre in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Madame Pomfrey," Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Madame Pomfrey, Put him here. What happened?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Madame Pomfrey," Who is it that the monsters taken, Minerva?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Marcus Flint, Quidditch practice.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Marcus Flint," Easy, Wood. Ive got a note."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Marcus Flint, A gift from Dracos father.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Marcus Flint, Yeah! Yeah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Im Moaning Myrtle! I wouldnt expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huhaaaah!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Ahh! Wait till you see. Its awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle, Aaah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Hee, ha, ha!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Ha, ha, ha!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huh huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Dont ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks its funny to throw a book at me."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle, Sure! Lets all throw books at Myrtle because she cant feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," I dont know, I didnt see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Oh! Whos there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. Id hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," I dont know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huhBut they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died. HARRY Just like that? How?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyesover there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Moaning Myrtle," Oh, Harry? If you die down there, youre welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I dont blame you, Harry dear."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Well, youd best hope that I dont put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! Thats it. There we go."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, Morning Arthur!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, Arthur!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Well, thatll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Oh, no."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, Well manage. Theres only one place were going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how its done. Yes. In you go Thats it."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," You see? Its quite easy, dear. Dont be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. Thats it, mind your head. Thats right. Now take your Floo powder. Thats it, very good. Now, dont forget to speak very, very clearly."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," What did he say, dear?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, I thought he did.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! Wed hoped youd only gone one grate too far"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, Ah! Here he is!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Harry, now you give me those, and Ill get them signed. All of you wait outside. Thats it, Ron."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, The train will be leaving any moment!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley, Okay.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," Come on, Ginny, well get you a seat. Hurry!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley," RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHERS NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND ITS ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WELL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Thhhhbt!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Uhh
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Hey, get me down!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Why is it always me?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Harry- I dont know who did it, but youd better come! Come on!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Harry- its Hermione!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy, Errol
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Oh look, its our Hogwarts letters. And theyve sent us Harrys as well."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Hello, Sir Nicholas!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy, Excuse me.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy," Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, It cant be- Harry Potter?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me, which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weeklys Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I dont talk about that. I didnt get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh hee, hee Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Lets see what you make of them, ha! Come on now- round them up, round them up, theyre only pixies! PIXIE Just stay there!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Peskipiksi pesternomi!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Ill ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Harry, Harry, Harry Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Sorry?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Voice?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," What are you talking about, Harry? I think were getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! Weve been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when ones having fun. Heh, heh."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasnt there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Im afraid thats my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Oh, poor boy doesnt know what hes saying. Now, this wont hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Much more flexible, though."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Gather round, gather round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I dont want any of you youngsters to worry- youll still have your Potions master when Im through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Whoaah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you dont mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah Lets have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Good luck, Potter."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Wands at the ready.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We dont want any accidents here. One, two--"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, My m-moment?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Very well- ah- Ill just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Books can be misleading!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldnt have sold half as well if people didnt think Id done all those things! HARRY Youre a fraud! Youve just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Yes, now you mention it. Im rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And Id never have sold another book. In fact, ahIm ahgoing to have to do the same to you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, Ill just be, ah Theres no need for me to stay."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Now, boys what good will it do?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Umbutobviously, yes. Sure you dont want to test it first? No! Aaaah! Its really quite filthy down here."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, It looks like a snake.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," The adventure ends here, boys. But dont fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Uhh Hello. Who are you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart," Its an odd sort of place this, isnt it? Do you live here?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Really? Well?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Ravenclaw,Movie_Professor Lockhart, Amazing! This is just like magic!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now its your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. One, two, three. Vera verto."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherins view, were unworthy to study magic."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," I think- do ya know- I think hes been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker (Poof)"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," What can this mean, Albus?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall, What should I tell the staff.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall, Oh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," This is out of my hands, Potter."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall, Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall, This match has been cancelled.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. Theres something the both of you have to see."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. All students will return to their house common rooms by six oclock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. I should tell you this unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. Im afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Well, thats settled. Well leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall, Ginny Weasley.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Could I have your attention, please?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Professor Sprout," Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Professor Sprout," Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Professor Sprout," Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries wont kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot All Aah! Ooh!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Professor Sprout, Got it? And now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Professor Sprout," Uh, Longbottoms been neglecting his earmuffs."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Hufflepuff,Movie_Professor Sprout," Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Youd better stand back. Lets go!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Come on.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ive got you Harry!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Drive!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Do you think itd be all right if we had some of this?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Its not much, but its home."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ginny. Shes been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks theyre fascinating."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Hes always doing that.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But Harrys never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Diagon Alley!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Mum fancies him.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whao!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I dont know. The gateways sealed its self for some reason.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Harry, if we cant get through, maybe Mum and Dad cant get back!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, The car
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Uh, right. Okay."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Okay.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, We cant be far behind.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, We must be gettin close.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yeah.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Welcome home.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Its not working! Ahhhh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh Aahh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whats happening?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Scabbers, you OK? The car! Dads gonna kill me."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well go and get our stuff, then."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Youre going to expel us, arent you?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Huhh Say it, Im doomed."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Bloody birds a menace. Oh, no!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What do we do now?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Youll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, (Blech)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, (Blech)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, (Blech)
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, (Blech) Its disgusting.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Hear what?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Kill?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I dont like spiders Whats that?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Are you mad?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahem. Vera verto!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Three guesses who.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Dyou think its true? Dyou think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Lets think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Of course. You heard him! Youll be next Mudbloods,"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Wicked! Malfoyll tell us anything.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ill stop it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls lavatory? Dont you think well get caught?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Why?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Who?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whos Moaning Myrtle?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Who cares?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Youre a Parselmouth? Why didnt you tell us?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oh, thats what you said to it!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Exactly! Now the whole schools gonna think youre his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, How?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahem
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yeah. Right.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, How thick could you get?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I think Im gonna be sick!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, That was close!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Look at your tail!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Have you spoken to Hermione?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yuck!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But, it cant hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, itll just go right through you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," We dont even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Thatll be a cheerful visit! Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Hermione!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, But you heard McGonagall! Were not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Thats Dads boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hagrids right! With Dumbledore gone, therell be an attack a day!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What?!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Theyre headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldnt it be follow the butterflies?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Harry, I dont like this Harry, I dont like this at all!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Can we go back now?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Harry.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Harry!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ahh- hhh
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Can we panic now?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Know any spells?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Wheres Hermione when you need her?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Glad were out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Thanks for that.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, The flying gears jammed!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Im trying!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, Ill kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whats that?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no ones dead?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," And Mrs. Norris? Im pretty sure she didnt have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, But hows a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Pipes? Its using the plumbing!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Moaning Myrtle.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever. Ginny
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What about my sister?!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Youre the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You cant go now!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Is there anything you can do?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Better you than us.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Ugh!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Go on.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whats this?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Harry! Harry!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Im fine!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, UmRon Weasley.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Lockharts memory charm backfired. He hasnt got a clue who he is!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, No!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Whatll do I do now?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, OK.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Thanks, sir!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Uhh-um Welcome back, Hermione."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Uh Harry?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Bloody hell!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Uh Bloody hell.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, But wheres Hermione?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Okay.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," What are you doing d- uh, I mean What are you doing down here?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Uhh
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, AhemStomachache.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, S- scar.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," No, maam, hes just fainted."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," Look, everyone! Weasleys got himself a Howler!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus, Cornish pixies?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Sir Nicholas," Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Sir Nicholas, Thank you!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Sir Nicholas, Good evening!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Gryffindor,Movie_Sir Nicholas, Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow thats been on these grounds since before you were born.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, dont recall seeing Potter at dinner."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Yes, Miss Granger?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Expelliarmus!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Weasleys wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. Well be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Dont move, Potter. Ill get rid of it for you."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Vipera evenesca.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Werent you saying just last night that youve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle,(rearranges) I AM LORD VOLDEMORT!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, Professor Dumbledore.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," About the school, as well? I dont have a home to go to. They wouldnt really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," No, sir. Nothing."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Good night, sir."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Evening, Hagrid. Im going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I dont think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, The dead girls parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Monsters dont make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Stand aside, Hagrid!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," I cant let you go. Theyll have your wand for this, Hagrid. Youll be expelled."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, She wont wake.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Shes still alive, but only just."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, It wont come until its called.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, You wont be needing it.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Im afraid I cant do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filchs cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Because I told her to. Youll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girls bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, It was my word against Hagrids. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldnt be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherins noble work."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Havent I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesnt matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemorts powers were destroyed?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air)"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Surely, you didnt think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle fathers name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, Dumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Lets match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue wont save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very much alive!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Remarkable isnt it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? Id guess you have little more than a minute to live. Youll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Im warning you, if you cant control that bloody bird itll have to go."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," I should think youd be a little more grateful. Weve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudleys second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Which should be any minute! AhemNow lets go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Good! And- and Dudley, you will be?"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Excellent! And you?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Ohh, dont mind that! Its just the cat."
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, So when they arrive at the ninth hole
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, What the devil are you doing up here?
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," One more sound, and youll wish youd never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said Look at all that water. A-and the second plumber said, Yes, and thats just the top of it!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Im so sorry! Its my nephew- hes very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. Thats why I kept him upstairs!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Youre never going back to that school. Youre never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Now, what the hells he doing? Potter!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Petunia, hes escaping!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Come here!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon arent going anywhere!"
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Chamber_Of_Secrets,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, Oh Damn.
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign. A snake slithers past the old man and into the room. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door. Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The old man looks terrified. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting. A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Harry! Harry is flustered and still panicing. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Are you alright? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Just now. You? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Last night. Hermione goes over to Ron's bed. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Wake up. Wake up Ronald! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Bloody hell. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Where are we actually going? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Haven't the foggiest, keep up! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,Arthur! It's about time son. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Yes sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,"Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yes sir. This way. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,Great great pleasure. They shake hands. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Pleasure to meet you too sir. They walk on up the hill. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"That's it sir, just over there. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,Shall we? We don't want to be late. Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Why are they all standing around that manky old boot? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,That isn't just any old manky boot mate. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,It's a portkey. Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,Time to go. Ready? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What's a 'portkey'? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,After 3. One... Two... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,Harry! Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,Three! There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through the air. Everyone cheers. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,Let go kids! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,What?? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Let! Go! Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,I bet that cleared your sinuses eh? Cedric helps Harry to his feet. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Thanks. They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup! They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small tent. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,"Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match. Amos and Cedric separate and walk off. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,See ya later Cedric. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,Home sweet home. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,Feet off the table. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,(Smiling) I love magic. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we? Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius,"Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Draco,"Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius,Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can. The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,Come on! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,It's the Irish! Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms leaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun appears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,"Here come the Bulgarians! Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins to chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,Yes! Viktor Krum waves to the crowd. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist. The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny,Think you're in love Ron? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,Sounds like the irish have got their pride on. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility. Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced and rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"What is THAT? They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry holds his head in pain. Suddenly they are fired on. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,Stop! That's my son. Arthur and others approach. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Which of you conjured this? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,You can't possibly.. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Crime? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Barty, they're just kids. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What crime? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Harry it's his mark. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Follow me. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,There was a man. Before. There. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"All of you, this way. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur,"Harry, who? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I dunno. I didn't see his face. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand. Ron sees he hasn't enough money. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"On second thought, just the drewbals. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,It's alright I'll get it. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Just the drewbals, thanks. Cho Chan walks up to the trolley. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Oh no thank you I'm not hungry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses. Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I'm fine. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream. Harry has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope and gives it to an owl. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,Clear the runway. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Well there's something you don't see every day. A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen... A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime. A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff. A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs, twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the ground with a spark effect. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum! The boys breathe some fire. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,Albus! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Igor. They embrace. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,"Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,"But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey. The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork into his hand. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,Wicked. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch. Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Alastor Moody? The aura. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days. This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he goes. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"My dear old friend, thanks for coming. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,That stupid roof. Mad-Eye takes a drink. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final. The crowd is unsettled, people are booing. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Silence! Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing a blue flame. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Alastor Moody. He writes his name on the board. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Three sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,And they are so named? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"So, which curse shall we see first? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Yes... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Give us a curse. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why. Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Hello. What a little beauty. He uses his wand to send it around the class. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Don't worry. Completely harmless. The class is unsettled. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,But if she bites... she's lethal! Draco laughs. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,What are you laughing at? Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself? Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up. Neville Longbottom stands. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,There's the um... The cruciatus curse. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse. Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it! Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider which is still making a noise. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger. Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face. They see a boy on the stairs facing the window. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Neville? Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Son. You alright? Neville nods. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yeah well rather you than me. The twins come up cheering. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,"Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,Cooked it up just this morning. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,It's not going to work. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,Oh yeah? And why's that Granger. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,So? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,That's why it's so brilliant. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,Ready Fred? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,"Ready George? They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have full heads of grey hair and beards. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,You said.. Fred You said.. They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection! Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum! The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes out. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory. Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup! People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads... "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Harry Potter. Harry Potter? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,No... No. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Harry Potter! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake. Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Voices in the crowd shout out. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,You're absolutely sure? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yes sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,Well of course he is lying. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,What do you suggest Minerva? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,You heard Barty the rules are clear. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Severus,"Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,I can do that. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,How did you do it? Harry is silent. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Let you know what? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,You know bloody well what. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Piss off. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,What a charismatic quartet. Hello! The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group. She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,"I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely. She takes Harry by the hand into a closet. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,This is cosy. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,It's a broomcupboard. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Oh, no. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,"So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve.. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I'm fourteen. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I dunno I haven't really thought about it. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Fourteen. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No I didn't enter. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,"Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,the 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Sirius? Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads ""THE CHAMPIONS ARE SELECTED"" and reads. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,"(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 2, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his... Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and puts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears in it. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Sirius?! How... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I dunno. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What are you saying? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I'm not ready for this Sirius. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Someone's coming! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Who you talking to? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Who says I was talking to anyone. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,I heard voices. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect. Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. The newspaper in the fire has the headline ""TEENAGE TRAGEDY"". "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,Amazing. Amazing. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Neville! You're doing it again! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,"Oh, right sorry. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,(reading a book) Magical water plants of the highland Lochs? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea. Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,(Whispering to Ron) We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again? Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry are not on speaking terms. Hermione walks up to Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Is that right? Well.... what? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Uhhh... She walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Well you can tell Ronald... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,I'm NOT an owl! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair? Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big red flower. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again. We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,Hagrid? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on. Harry does as he's told. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,Bonsoir Olympe. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,"Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,Couldn't forget you Olympe. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,You'll be glad you came. Trust me. A dragon nearby gives a loud roar. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,"Ahh, c'est magnifique! In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring and breathing fire. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Madame Maxime,Can we get closer? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures. A huge flame fires up. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Ron was here? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Thanks. Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Excuse me.. They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl off more insults. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,(to Cedric) Can I have a word? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Alright. They walk away some distance. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,"Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,"Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Don't worry about it. Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,(To Ron) You're a right foul git you know that? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,You think so? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I know so. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Anything else? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yeah. Stay away from me. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Fine. Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Draco,Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic. Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Professor Moody what are you doing? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Teaching. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Is that a student? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Technically it's a ferret. Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs. Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back to normal. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Draco,My father will hear about this! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Is that a threat! Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,He might've mentioned it. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Well you will do well to remember it. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,(To Harry) come with me. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me. A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Better than fair the way I heard it. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,But I'm not allowed a broom. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,You're allowed a wand. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Pssst! Harry? Is that you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yeah. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Battle a dragon. Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes, Rita Skeeter the journalist approaches. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Viktor,(To Rita) You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Rita,No matter. We've got what we wanted. Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate. The champions gather around him in a circle. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,What are you doing here Miss Granger? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Barty. The bag. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will... Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,The welsh green. Mr Krum... Viktor takes another out 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,The chinese fireball. Oooooh. Cedric picks one. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,The swedish short-snout. Which leaves... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,The horntail... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,What's that boy? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Nothing. Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon... The cannon fires immediately. Transcribed by IMSDb.com 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant. Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name. He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Your wand harry! Your wand! Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look stunned. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,We knew you wouldn't die Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,Lose a leg. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,Or an arm. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,Pack it in altogether. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus,"Go on Harry, what's the clue? Seamus hands Harry the golden egg. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it? He opens the egg and a loud horrific screech comes out, he closes it again. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What the bloody hell was that? Ron appears in the doorway. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,"Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Caught on have you. Took you long enough. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,At least I warned you about the dragons. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Hagrid warned me about the dragons. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Boys. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,(Reading a newspaper) Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow. A young boy walks up holding a package. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Nigel,Parcel for you Mr Weasley. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Thank you Nigel. Nigel is gazing at Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Not now Nigel. Later. Go on. Nigel leaves. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress?? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Ginny these must be for you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny,I'm not wearing that it's ghastly. Hermione laughs. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,What are you on about? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Dress robes? for what? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance. Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem a lot more excited. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,(Whispering to George) Try saying that five times faster. They try. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"(Continued) Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me. She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"Now, place your right hand on my waist. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Where? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,My waist. He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Now bend your arm. Mr Filch... The music starts. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"One two three, one two three, one two three. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"Everybody come together. The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all still seated. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"Boys, on your feet. Neville stands. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I think I'd take the dragon right now. Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser. They laugh together and have a moment. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates. Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Well, us and Neville! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,But then again he can take himself. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone. Ron gasps. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Now I'm really depressed. Fred hands Ron a note, it reads ""GET A MOVE ON OR ALL THE GOOD "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Well Hermione, you're a girl. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Oh well spotted. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Bloody hell. Hermione storms off. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Agreed. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Cho! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Ok thanks. Cho? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What happened to you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,What? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What did she say? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,No of course. Ron shakes his head. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,She said yes?? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Don't be silly. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What did you do then? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me. The Patil twins walk past. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Patils,Hi Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Hey! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Bloody hell. Harry walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,What are those?? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,My dress robes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Well I expect yours are more traditional. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie. He sniffs at his clothes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Leave it alone. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Who? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud. The boys approach the Patil twins. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati,Hello boys. Don't you look... She looks at Ron. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati,... dashing. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Ready professor? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil. Hermione enters the room all dressed up. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati,She looks beautiful. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yeah she does. Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and they walk together. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Padma,(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,No. Absolutely not. Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with their partners. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati,Harry. Take my waist. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati,"Now. They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall, Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes up after a great time with Viktor. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,What's got your wand in a knot? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind. Hermione walks off. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Padma,Are you going to ask me to dance or not? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,No. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,(To Hermione) He's using you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Doubt it. He's way too old. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,What? What? That's what you think? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Yeah that is what I think. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,You know the solution then don't you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Go on. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Well that's completely off the point. Harry... Harry walks up. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you. Harry and Ron walk away. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,They get scary when they get older. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Ron you spoil everything! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldermort,Let me see it again. A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on the arm. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting! Harry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking up to his bed. It's Neville. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,You alright Harry? I just got in. Me! He chuckles and dances off. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,What's that supposed to mean? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Hey Potter. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Cedric. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,How are you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Spectacular. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor? Harry nods. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I must be out of my mind. He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle,I'd try putting it in the water if I were you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Myrtle! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle,Long time no see. The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle,I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water? Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle,"Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric. Harry takes the egg and puts it under the water. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle,"Well go on, open it. Harry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle,"Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone... Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Harry, tell me again. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Come seek us where our voices sound. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"The black lake, that's obvious. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,An hour long you'll have to look. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out. Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and... "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom! Neville appears from behind a bookcase. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Why don't you help Potter put his books back. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,"You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,You're sure about this Neville. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,Absolutely. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,For an hour. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,Most likely. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Most likely? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,You're telling me this now? You must be joking. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,I just wanted to help. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,You seem a little tense Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Do I? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,(To Harry) Put that in your mouth. Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"(Continued) You may begin at the start of the cannon. The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of them dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of gilliweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus,What's the matter with him? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville,Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter! Harry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,But she's my friend too! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Merperson,Only one. What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that it has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for the surface. Harry frees Ron. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Harry! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Get him another towel. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,I want all the judges over here now. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Well... yeah... a bit Fleur kisses him too. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Merci. Hermione comes up to Harry with a towel. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Harry! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Hermione 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably. Hermione kisses Harry on the head. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I finished last Hermione. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Next to last. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory! Cedric and his friends cheer. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre. As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering him. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred,All that moral fibre eh? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_George,Well done 'moral fibre'. Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter. Mad-Eye approaches them. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out! Barty walks away from him. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,And they say I'm mad. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,We're still misfits. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray! They walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Mr Crouch? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge,I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Then for once show them some. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge,The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge,What did you say? What did you say to me? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private. Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge,Harry! Harry how good to see you again. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I can come back later Professor. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp. Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips at his hand. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Agh! A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore is seated next to where Harry is. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Professor? The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,"Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,I do sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,What do you wish to present? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Mr Rosier is dead. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,Dead? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he. Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,I didn't know. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,If that is all the witness has to offer... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am. Igor protests loudly. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Silence! Barty hits the gavel repeatedly. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,What's that? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,The name... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,Yes? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and... "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,The name! Give me the wretched name! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"Barty Crouch! ... Junior. Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic, he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar. Guards seize Barty junior. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Jr,Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty,You are no son of mine. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Jr,the 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Have there been other dreams like this? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply... Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic out from his head. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Cast them away. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Igor,"It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I. The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Severus,"Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yes sir. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Severus,"Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Bubble juice sir? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Severus,"Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I haven't stolen anything. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Severus,"Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why. Severus closes the door in Harry's face. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory... The crowd cheer on hearing his name. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum... The bulgarian crowd go nuts. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"(continued) The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"(To the contestants) In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Champions! Prepare yourselves. Cedric hugs his father. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"On the count of three... ONE... The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans. Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances. The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing the maze, creature noises are all around. Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being swallowed into the undergrowth. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Fleur? Fleur! He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry runs. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,"Get down! Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No stop! He's bewitched Cedric. They struggle. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Get off me! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,He's bewitched! The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric is pinned down with no means of escape. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Harry! Harry! Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps him up. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,For a moment so did I. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Some game huh? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Some game. The wind starts blowing again. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,"Go. Take it, you saved me! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Together, on three. One, two, three! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,You ok? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Yeah, you? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Where are we? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I've been here before. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now! "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,"What are you talking about? Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,What is it? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Get back to the cup! We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,Who are you? What do you want? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,Kill the spare. Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Cedric! Cedric lays dead on the ground. Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and traps him. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Do it, now! Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,My wand Wormtail. Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,Hold out your arm. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"The other arm Wormtail. Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been summoned. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me. Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Not even you, Lucius. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius,My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"There were signs my friend, and more than whispers. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius,"I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail. Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome boy. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Don't touch him. Harry struggles to get free. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now! Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow! Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,That's better. And now... Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up. Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes. Harry takes steps toward Voldemort. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Have it your way. They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine! Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's voice. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric,(voice) Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,No! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Harry! Harry! Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Tell me what happened! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge,"Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos,Let me through! That's my son! My boy! Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Are you alright Potter? Harry nods. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Does it hurt? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Not so much now. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"I'd better take a look at it. We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,What was it like? What was he like? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Who? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares. Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles and struggles to find one. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,"Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others? "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh?? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But... Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter. A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall. Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye by the neck... 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Severus... Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Do you know who I am? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,Albus Dumbledore. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Mad-Eye,No. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Is he in this room? Is he in this room? We see a nod. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Harry get away from there! Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Are you alright Alastor? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Alastor,I'm sorry Albus. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"That's Moody, but then who's...? Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Severus,Polyjuice potion. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus. Dumbledore looks into the pit. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"We'll get you up in a minute. Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises. He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty Crouch Junior. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Barty Crouch Junior. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Jr,I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Your arm Harry. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Jr,You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Jr,I'll be welcomed back like a hero. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared. Harry nods. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,No Entry,Movie_Viktor,Write to me. Promise. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Bye. Ron is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both in turn give him a kiss on the head. "
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,No. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No I don't think so. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Everything's going to change now isn't it? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yes. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you. 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Well I won't. You know I won't! 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Harry will won't you? 
Goblet_Of_Fire,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Yeah. Every week. They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage head off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater."

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine Granger,"I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us all killed. Or worse, expelled."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy,"You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"What happened down in the dungeon between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Only a person who wanted to find the Stone - find it, but not use it  would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape,"There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention. Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?...And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?...Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape,"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell... We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, [to the cat] I should have known that you would be here... Professor McGonagall.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good and the bad."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, And the boy?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Hagrid is bringing him.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Ah, Professor. I would trust Hagrid with my life."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. [hands Dumbledore a bundle  Harry] Try not to wake him. There you go."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day, they're the worst sort of... Muggles imaginable. They really are"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, The only family he has.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, This boy will be famous! There won't be a child in our world that doesn't know his name!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that... until he is ready. [Dumbledore places Harry on the doorstep. Hagrid snivels.] There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. [Hagrid nods. Dumbledore places a letter on Harry.] Good luck... Harry Potter."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, [about his gifts] How many are there?

Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dudley, I don't care how big they are!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [when Dudley doesn't answer] Because theres no post on Sundays?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," Right you are, Harry! [takes cookie from Harry] Right you are. No post on Sundays. Hah!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Excuse me. Who are you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Of course, you know all about Hogwarts."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sorry, no."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," No? Blimey, Harry, did you ever wonder where your Mum and Dad learned it all?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Learnt what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," You're a wizard, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I I'm a what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," A wizard! And a thumpin' good 'un, I'll wager, once you've been trained up a bit."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I think you've made a mistake. I mean, I... can't be a... a wizard. I mean, I'm... just... Harry. Just Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, ""Just Harry""... did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [to the Dursleys; angrily after Vernon refuses Harry's entrance to Hogwarts because they swore when they took him in to ""put a stop to all this rubbish""] You knew? You knew all along, and you never told me?!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia," [bitterly] Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being what she was. My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. ""We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?"" I was the only one who saw her for what she was"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," ""Blown up""? You told me my parents died in a car crash!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, [shocked and angry] A car crash?! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter?!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia, [sheepishly] We had to say something...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, He will not be going!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," [somewhat amused] Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's gonna stop him, are ya?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," ""Muggle""?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Non-magic folk. [to the Dursleys, angrily] This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Never... insult Albus Dumbledore... in front of me.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander, Curious... Very curious...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sorry... but what's curious?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. And it just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand, when its brother gave you that scar."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, ....And who owned that wand?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But. I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes... but great."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. [points to his scar. Hagrid looks hesitant to respond] You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," [sighs and leans towards him] First  and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important  not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. And a few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V [becomes tense] His name was V"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Maybe if you wrote it down?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Nah, I can't spell it. All right... [in a whisper] Voldemort."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Voldemort?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," [frantically] Shh! It was dark times, Harry, dark times. [As Hagrid narrates, we see a flashback of a robed, hooded figure - Voldemort - breaking into Harry's parents' home and striking his mother dead; it ends just as Voldemort aims his wand at baby Harry] Voldemort started to gather some followers; brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. Nobody. Not one. Except you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Me? Voldemort tried to kill... me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on yer forehead. A mark like that only comes from bein' touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, And what happened to Vol To You-Know-Who?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's still out there somewhere, too tired to carry on. But one thing's fer certain"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, No.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [sees Ron attempting magic] Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [clears throat] Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow... turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good is it? [Ron gives Harry an indignant and exasperated look] Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself, but they've all worked for me. For example, [sits in front of Harry] Oculus Reparo."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [muffled] Um, Ron Weasley."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [chagrined] Pleasure. You two best change into robes, I expect we'll be arriving soon. [leaves, but turns around to face Ron] You've got dirt on your nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," So it's true, then. What they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. [All the first years murmur in excitement; Draco indicates two boys next to him] This is Crabbe, and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. [Ron sniggers; Draco turns to glare at him] Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down-robe? You must be a Weasley. [turns back to Harry] You'll soon find out some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [offers his hand]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [coldly] I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too badly! Can't make any promises. Rough game, Quidditch."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Brutal! But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally (Harry and Ron walk off) but they'll turn up in a month or two!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. They were three!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," It was standing on a trapdoor. Which means, it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Guarding something?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. [Goes into her dormitory]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, She needs to sort out her priorities.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," [Leading Harry to practice, carrying a trunk] Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think so. [Tosses Quaffle back to Oliver] What are those? [Acknowledges two other balls]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," Oh. [Takes out a bat, a little shorter that a baseball bat] You better take this. [Hands bat to Harry, then unlatches one of the balls from trunk. It shoots up into the air, then zooms back down] Careful now, it's comin' back. [Harry whacks the ball with the bat. The ball zooms off in another direction right though the gap of a statue that has crossed swords] Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. [The ball comes back heading directly for Oliver] Uh-oh. [It whacks him in the chest, knocking him over. He fights with it to get it back in the trunk. He eventually succeeds, and locks it back in]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What was that thing?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver, [Panting] Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you... [Points to Harry]...are a Seeker. [Takes out walnut-sized gold ball with silver wings] The only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. [Hands it to Harry]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I like this ball.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What do I do with it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Oliver," You catch it... before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game's over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Hallowe'en?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Who told you about Fluffy?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," ""Fluffy""?!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, That thing has a name?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Of course, he's got a name! He's mine! I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. The I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yes?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top-secret, that is."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Codswallop! Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Exactly.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [In a timid, high voice] Okay."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy," Okay, then I get Fang."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," We... [Snape looks to her, expecting an answer]...we were just..."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, You ought to be more careful. People may think you're...[Snape notices Harry eyeing him cautiously. He glares sharply at Harry]...up to something.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You? No, it can't it can't be. Snape, he was he was the one who"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? But next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded! Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Snape was... trying to save me?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," I knew you were a danger to me right from the off, especially after Halloween."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Th-th-then you let the troll in!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He barely left me alone. But he doesn't understand - I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? Yes, I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Use the boy.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," COME HERE, POTTER!!! NOW!!! [Harry walks to Quirrell and the Mirror of Erised] Tell me. What do you see? [Harry sees his reflection take out the Philosopher's Stone, then places it into his pocket. He realizes that it actually is in his pocket.] What is it, what do you see?!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, He lies.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell, TELL THE TRUTH!!! WHAT DO YOU SEE?!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Let me speak to him.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Quirrell," Master, you are not strong enough!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, I have strength enough for this...
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, Harry Potter. We meet again.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Voldemort?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [Harry attempts to escape] STOP HIM! [Quirrell blocks Harry by snapping his fingers, causing a large fire to block off the entrance] Don't be a fool. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me and live?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Never!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," [laughs] Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... would you like to see your mother and father again? [Harry's parents appear in the Mirror of Erised] Together, we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. [Harry pulls the Stone out of his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power... and those too weak to seek it. Together, we can do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [screams] YOU LIAR!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," KILL HIM! [Quirrell flies into the air and begins choking Harry. Harry tries to reach for the stone, but grabs Quirrell's wrist, and suddenly makes it immediately begin to burn and turn into ash. Quirrell gasps, screams, and lets go of Harry in fear and he starts to panic] What is this magic?! Fool! Get the Stone!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry reaches up to touch his scar] No, no. This kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What is it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," [smiling] Love, Harry. Love."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm not going home... not really.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hi, Hedwig. [Hedwig has just flown down to the table where Harry, Ron and Hermoine are studying]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I'm ready! Ask me any question.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, ...I forgot.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Copy off you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us! [checks a card, irritated] Dumbledore again!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [Neville comes hopping in, his legs apparently stuck together] Leg-Locker Curse?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Malfoy. [Neville approaches them amidst laughter from the other students]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom, [wobbling uncontrollably] How? I can barely stand at all!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan," [jumping up, wand at the ready] I'll do the counter-curse!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan," [slamming his wand down angrily] I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back! [stalks off angrily, showing a large chunk of hair missing from the back of his head]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I found him! [hands Ron a Chocolate Frog card of Dumbledore]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945'"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Go on.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," '-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [beaming excitedly] Follow me!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?! [before he can say another word he topples over backwards, the other students start laughing]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Will I have to wear that too?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," You? Go to Smeltings? [Harry nods, questionably]"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, HA!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Petunia," Don't be so stupid, you're going to go the state school where you belong. [Goes to the kitchen and fishes out a grey shirt in a boiler.] And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny Weasley, Leave him alone.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," [Smirking] Oh, look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," [Places the silver snake of his walking stick on Draco's shoulder] Now, now, Draco. Play nicely. [To Harry] Mr. Potter. Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me. [uses the silver snake to pull back Harry's bangs; sees his scar] Your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [firmly] Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Hmm, you must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [Indirectly quoting Dumbledore] Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," And you must be... Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you... and your parents. [glances at the Grangers, who are speaking with Mr. Weasley] Muggles, aren't they? [Looks at Ron] Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions... [Takes a book out of Ginny's cauldron] Tatty, secondhand book. [Smiles coldly] You must be the Weasleys."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," [Arriving and attempting to ignore Mr. Malfoy ] Children, it's mad in here. Let's go outside."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Well, well, well. Weasley Senior."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley, Lucius.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur. All those extra raids; I do hope they're paying you overtime. [Picks up one of Ginny's books] Though judging by the state of this, I'd say not. [Places the book back in Ginny's cauldron; another book has been slipped in with it, though only Harry notices] What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard... if they don't even pay you well for it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Clearly. Associating with Muggles... And I thought your family could sink no lower. [Mr. Weasley glares at Mr Malfoy.] I'll see you at work.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy, See you at school.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape'S Voice, You were seen! By no less than seven Muggles! [He throws the newspaper down and glares at Harry and Ron] Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world! Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Silence! I assure you that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home, tonight! As it is..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, They are not.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Headmaster... these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," We'll go and get our stuff, then."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detentions."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dean Thomas, Ron? Is that your owl?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, That bloody bird's a menace. [looks at the letter] Oh no!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan," Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once... [looking uneasy] It was horrible!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mrs. Weasley Via Howler," RONALD WEASLEY!!!!! (The Howler forms itself into a ranting mouth) HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR?!?!? I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!!!!! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!!!!! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!!!!! (The Howler turns to Ginny, who is eating her breakfast; its voice is now quiet and loving) Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. (The Howler turns back to Ron and blows a raspberry at him, then tears itself to pieces)"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Those are Nimbus Two-Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Marcus Flint, A gift from Draco's father.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," [Annoyed] No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! Eat slugs!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You okay, Ron? [Ron's face turns green] Say something!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Colin Creevey," [starts taking pictures of Ron] Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," No, Colin! Get out of the way. [he and Hermione help Ron to his feet] Let's take him to Hagrid. [Ron regurgitates another slug] He'll know what to do."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," Yes, Miss Granger?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," Professor, I was wondering if you'd tell us about the Chamber of Secrets."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Minerva Mcgonagall," [seeing everyone's faces] Very well. Well, you all knew, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago, by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, [Sarcastic] Three guesses who.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Minerva Mcgonagall," Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families  in other words, ""pure-bloods"". Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though shortly before departing, he sealed it... until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, Muggle-borns.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Minerva Mcgonagall," Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall, Well the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. it is said to be the home... of a monster.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart," Let me introduce my assistant... Professor Snape. [Snape grudgingly walks up onto the platform] He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him! Never fear. [Lockhart and Snape approach each other, bow to each other, walk a fair distance apart and ready their wands.] One, two, three..."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Expelliarmus!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [concerned] Do you think he's all right?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [laughs] Who cares?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart," An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape! But if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious, uh, what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," [losing patience] Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor?"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart," An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Uh... Let's have a volunteer pair. Uh, Potter, Weasley. How about you?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. He'd be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," Scared, Potter?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You wish.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy Weasley, Excuse me!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley [As Vincent Crabbe]," What are you doing dow [Harry hits him; Ron clears his throat and speaks more authoritatively] I mean, What are you doing down here?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy Weasley," I happen to be a school Prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors this time of night. What's your names again?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley [As Vincent Crabbe], Uh...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter [As Gregory Goyle], I'm...
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," [Rounding a corner] Crabbe! Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? [Looks oddly at Harry, who is still wearing his glasses] Why are you wearing glasses?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter [As Gregory Goyle], [Quickly removes his glasses] Um... Um... reading.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," Reading? [Harry nods] I didn't know you could read. [Turns to Percy] And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Percy Weasley," Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world  all of them! [Ron (disguised as Crabbe) clenches his fist angrily] What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [gets nudged by Harry (disguised as Goyle)] Ahem... stomachache.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You're wrong!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," [sternly] What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? [""Goyle"" doesn't reply.] Well? Do you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [gulps] Harry Potter?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, then, you must have some idea who's behind it all."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? [picks up the package and shakes it] Is this yours? [Harry shakes his head] But, my father did say this"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's his... stomachache.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle, Come to throw something else at me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why would I throw something at you?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle," Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle," [flies down at him furiously] SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get it through her stomach! [punches through Ron's] Fifty points if it goes through her HEAD! [punches through his]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But who threw it at you, anyway?"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle," [more calmly] I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, [sighs] and it fell through the top of my head. Mm-hmm! [nods and floats away, sobbing]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber if Secrets 50 years ago.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine, It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty rotten snitch to me.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Look, Hagrid is our friend, so why don't we just go and ask him?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [Sarcastically] That will be a cheerful visit. ""Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you sent anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"""
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," [Appears from behind] Mad and hairy? Yer wouldn't be talkin' about me, now are ya?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,"Movie_Harry, Ron, And Hermione", No!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_'Harry," [notices the canister of liquid Hagrid is carrying] What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Oh, it's, uh, flesh-eating slug repellent. For the mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, theyve still got a bit of growing to do. But, once their acnes been cleared up, well be able to chop them and stew them, and then well get those people down at the hospital un-petrified. In the meantime, though, you three... had best be looking after yourselves, all right? [turns and walks back where he came from; Neville starts running from in the direction Hagrids going] Hello, Neville."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," [knowing that Harry and Ron are inside the hut, in the invisibility cloak] If... um... If anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yep. That would leave them right. That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge," [to Fang] Good boy. [He, Hagrid and Lucius Malfoy leave. Harry and Ron remove the cloak of invisibility.]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Look. [sees a trail of spiders on Hagrid's window] Come on. [grabs a lantern] Come on, Fang. Come on."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You heard what Hagrid said. ""Follow the spiders."""
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," They're heading to the Dark Forest! [Harry ignores him] Why spiders?! Why couldn't be ""follow the butterflies""?! [follows Harry out the door]"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog, Who is it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [to a terrified Ron] Don't panic.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog, Hagrid? Is that you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," We're friends of Hagrid. [A colossal, tarantula-like spider emerges] You... You're Aragog, aren't you?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog, Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, he's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog, That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Then you're not the monster?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog," No. The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [noticing other giant spiders around them; whimpering] Harry...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Shush. [to Aragog] Well, if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog, We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature that we spiders fear above all others.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But have you seen it?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog," I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [sounding like he's about to cry] Harry?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [irritated] What?! [Ron points upwards in terror  giant spiders descend and surround them] [to Aragog] Well... thank you. We'll just go.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aragog," Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command, but I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friends of Hagrid."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [to Harry] Can we panic now? [the spiders move in for the attack] Know any spells?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, One  but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Where's Hermione when you need her?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [reads the paper from the book taken by Hermione] ""Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it."" Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. [reads again] ""Spiders flee before it."" It all fits!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hermione's answered that too.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," ""Pipes?"" It's using the plumbing!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Moaning Myrtle.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself! The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart, [entering] So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart, My moment?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart, Very well. I'll just be in my office getting... getting ready.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Poppy Pomfrey," Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall, Ginny Weasley.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [reads it] ""Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever"". Ginny..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Are you going somewhere?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart," [nervously] Um, well, yes. Urgent call, unavoidable. Got to go..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What about my sister?!
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart," Well, as to that - most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, You're the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart," I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You're running away, after all that stuff you did in your books?!"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart, Books can be misleading.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You wrote them!
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart," My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [realizing, outraged] You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Is there anything you can do?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart," Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. And now, I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Don't even think about it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's a snake skin.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Bloody hell. Whoever shed this must be 60 feet long, or more. [Lockhart pretends to pass out. Ron notices.] Heart of a lion, this one."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Lockhart," [jumps up and grabs Ron's wand; aims the wand at Harry, then at Ron, then at Harry again] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. [Points it at Ron] The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [Aims it at Harry] You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye... to your memories. Obliviate!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Harry?! Harry!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Ron! Ron, are you okay?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I'm fine.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart, [sits up and grins at Ron] Hello. Who are you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Uh, Ron Weasley."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart," Really? And, um, who-who am I?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [to Harry] Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart," [picks up a rock] It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? Do you live here?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [takes the rock from Lockhart] No.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Gilderoy Lockhart, Really?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What do I do now?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You wait here and try to shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Okay.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Ginny. [Runs to her] Ginny. Ginny. Please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, [suddenly appears out of nowhere] She won't wake.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won't wake? She's not...?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," She's still alive, but only just."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Are you a ghost?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [touches her hand] She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [Tom picks up Harry's wand] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk--"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, It won't come until it's called.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Give me my wand, Tom."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, You won't be needing it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Listen, we've got to go, we've got to save her!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger. Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No. She couldn't. I mean, she wouldn't!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and Filch's cat. [flashback of Ginny watching the Chamber's entrance in the toilets open] It was Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [flashback of Ginny writing the massages]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But why?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very... persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was in, shall we say, a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her, and she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. [flashback of Ginny running into a toilet cubicle and throwing the diary into the toilet] And then who should find it... but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, And why did you want to meet me?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [angrily] Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [smiling] I bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary  preserving my sixteen year-old self in its pages so that one day, I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Haven't I told you? Killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target... has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape, with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Voldemort... is my past, present, and future. [uses Harry's wand to write his full name in midair"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [stunned] You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle," Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name. A name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Fawkes suddenly enters the chamber] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops the Sorting Hat to Harry and leaves]
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle, So... this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Oh, yes."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, And...? Who was it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, [after exchanging a look with Harry] Voldemort.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Ah.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Only this time, he chose to act through somebody else... by means of this. [He reveals Tom Riddle's diary  which Lucius had slipped into Ginny's cauldron. Dobby tugs Harry's sleeve uneasily and looks over at Lucius.]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius, I see.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... severe."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Well... let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Don't worry. I will be.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! [Lucius turns around] I have something of yours. [Hands him the diary]
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," You do, do you? [Hands the diary to Dobby] Well...[Whispers] why don't you prove it? [Harry doesn't answer because he just did] Come, Dobby."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [Whispers to Dobby] Open it.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Dobby?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, Master has given Dobby a sock.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, What? [Turns around] I didn't give
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, [Holding the sock in delight] Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, [Furious] You lost me my SERVANT! [Pulls his wand from his cane and aims it directly at Harry. Dobby then stands in his way]
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dobby, You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," [About to curse Harry] Avada [Dobby blasts him backwards across the hall; Lucius stands] Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. Mark my words, Potter"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter,Diagonally!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter,You wish.

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Mr. Weasley, Why would I go looking for somebody who wants to kill me?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,[to Sirius] I know why! You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[quietly] He was their friend... and he betrayed them... [yelling] HE WAS THEIR FRIEND! [echoes] I hope he finds me! 'Cause when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"You can see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him. When we free him, I'll never have to back to the Dursley's. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"You were right, Hermione, it wasn't my dad I saw earlier, it was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because...well, Id already done it! Does that make sense?"

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"[Observing his leg after Sirius, as a dog, attacked him] It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,What are you trying do to him?! [Sirius snatches Scabbers from Ron] Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,[while looking at a past version of herself using the time turner] Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"[To Malfoy] You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"[To Sirius] If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us, too!"

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius,[to Snape] Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge,"Come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge,Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew... he destroyed him!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge," Do they use the cane at St. Brutus', boy?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [catching Uncle Vernon's eye] Oh yeah, yeah, I've been beaten loads of times."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge," Excellent. I won't hear any of this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not beating someone when they deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out, Vernon. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it that the boy's father did, Petunia?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Petunia," Oh, nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge," And a drunk too, no doubt?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [irritated] That's a lie!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge, What did you say?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [getting angry] My dad wasn't a drunk!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge," Oh, don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, [to Harry] I think it's time you went to bed.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge," Actually, it's nothing to do with the father, it has to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [yelling angrily at Aunt Marge with a snap] SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Aunt Marge, Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- [Her finger starts to inflate.]
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon," [angrily, shouting at the top of his lungs at Harry] YOU BRING HER BACK!!! You bring her back now and you put her right!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No! She deserved what she got! [Uncle Vernon furiously tries to grab Harry with a savage yell, but Harry stands up to him with his wand] Keep away from me."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yeah? Try me.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Uncle Vernon, They won't let you back now. You have nowhere to go.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I don't care. Anywhere's better than here. [angrily leaves the house and storms off]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," It's a cat, Ronald; what do you expect? It's in his nature."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," That's rich, coming from the owner of that smelly old shoebrush."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," You're not flashing that clipping about again, are you Ron?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I haven't shown anyone!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George," No, not a soul!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Not unless you count Tom...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, The day maid...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, The night maid...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, That bloke came to who fix the toilet...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, And that wizard from Belgium!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_The Fat Lady, [In a painting; she sings while holding a glass] Ah ah ah ahhh!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Fortuna Major.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_The Fat Lady," No, wait, wait! [Sings in a higher pitch] Ah ah ah ahhh!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [Irritated] Fortuna Major.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_The Fat Lady," No, no, no! Wait, wait! Watch this! [Screams] Ah ah ah AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH! [The Fat Lady surreptitiously looks around to make sure nobody's watching, then smashes the glass on a pillar in the painting] Oh, amazing! Just with my voice!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [Impatient] Fortuna Major!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_The Fat Lady," [Petulant] Yes, all right, all right, you can go in."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [Exasperated] Thank you!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_The Fat Lady, Plebs.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Peaky?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George," Yeah, Ron. Let's walk you off the top of the Astronomy tower."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, And see what you look like.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [coming to] Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George," Gave us a right good scare there, mate."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Harry, are you all right?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [jokingly] Brilliant. [serious again] What happened?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, you fell off your broom."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [sarcastically] Oh, really? I meant the match. Who won?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Um... no one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore was furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them straight off."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," There's um... something else you should know about, too, Harry. When you fell, your broom, it sort of blew into the Whomping Willow and... [Holds up what's left of the destroyed handle of Harry's Nimbus 2000] ...Well."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [looking at the Marauder's Map for the first time] Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... no. Is that really...?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Dumbledore...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, In his study....
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Pacing...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Does that a lot.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, So this map shows...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Everyone.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Everyone?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Everyone.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Where they are...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, ...what they're doing...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, ...every minute...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, ...of every day!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Brilliant!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Professor Snape, Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I was sleepwalking.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," How extraordinarily like your father, you are, Potter. He too was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [irritated] My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would lower your wand."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, [Lowers his wand] Turn out your pockets. [Harry just stands there] [sternly] Turn out your pockets. [Harry takes out the Marauder's Map] What's this?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Spare bit of parchment.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Really? Open it. [Harry opens the map; Snape puts his wand on the map] Reveal your secrets. [To Harry] Read it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," ""Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."""
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Go on.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [amused] ""...and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."""
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Why you insolent, little--!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Lupin, Professor.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," [to Harry] Harry, are you all right?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," That remains to be seen. [takes the Marauder's Map] I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks to me as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it. [chuckles] I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. [to Harry] Harry, would you come with me, please. [to Professor Snape] Professor, good night."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy, [to Crabbe and Pike] Father said I could have the hippogriff's head. Maybe I'll donate it to the Gryffindor Common Room.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Crabbe, Look who's here.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy, Ah! Come to see the show?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [furiously] You! You foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach! [holds Malfoy at wandpoint]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hermione, no! He's not worth it!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, That felt good.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [impressed] Not good. Brilliant!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," Severus, don't be a fool."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," He can't help it Remus, it's habit by now."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," Sirius, be quiet."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Be quiet yourself, Remus!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," [puts wand on Sirius' throat] I could do it, you know? But why deny the Dementors, when they're so longing to see you? Do I detect a flicker of fear? Ah yes, a Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness but I'll do my best!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin, He was at school with us. we thought he was our friend!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No. Pettigrew's dead. [to Sirius] You killed him!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin, No he didn't. I thought so too until you mention seeing Pettigrew on the map.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," The map was lying, then."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's [points to Scabbers] right there!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Me?! He's mental!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, Not you! You're rat!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Scabbers has been in my family for...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," 12 years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, So what?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, All they could find left of Pettigrew was his...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, Finger! But then the dirty coward cut it off so that everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Show me. [Sirius tries to take the rat from Ron, but Ron holds onto it] Give it to him, Ron."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," What are you trying do to him? [Sirius finally gets a hold of the rat] Scabbers! Leave him alone! [tries to run toward Sirius, but Hermione holds him back] Get off him! What are you doing? Scabbers!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Peter Pettigrew," [realizes he's not a rat anymore] Remus? S-Sirius? My old friends! [runs toward the door, but Lupin and Sirius block him] Harry! Look at you! [walks toward Harry] You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, How dare you speak to Harry?! [Pettigrew scowls and runs away from Sirius] How dare you talk about James in front of him?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Pettigrew," I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you've done? What would you've done?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, I would have died! [Pettigrew crawls under piano] I would have died rather than betray my friends!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Pettigrew," [runs over to Harry, whispering to him] Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... your dad would have spared me! He would shown me mercy...!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! [he and Lupin pull out their wands and point them and Pettigrew] Together!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," Harry, this man is..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I know what he is. But we'll take him up to the castle.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Pettigrew," Bless you, boy! Bless you!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Get off! I said we'll take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, I just didn't think my dad would've wanted his two best friends to become killers. Besides, dead the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Pettigrew," Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [to Harry and Hermione, who have just disappeared and reappeared in thin air] How did you get there? I was just talking to you there! And now you're there!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," What's he talking about, Harry?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I don't know. Honestly Ron, how can somebody be in two places at once?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until my father hears that Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Shut up, Malfoy."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco," Dementor, Dementor."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slytherin Students, Oooooooooooh!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," Very well, Kill him. But wait one more minute Harry has the right to know why."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, (to Sirius) I know why! You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Who was it then?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room, right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, [barges in and disarms Sirius' wand] Expelliarmus!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy,Potter? [Harry turns] Is it true you fainted? [Pike pretends to swoon] I mean that you actually fainted?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [turning Harry away] Shove off, Malfoy!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,[To Ron] I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory. I just want to be... Look. I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why. It just did. Okay?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[To Ron] You're a right foul git, you that?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[To Draco] I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile, and cruel... and you're just pathetic."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,[On attempting to ask girls out] Why do they have to travel in packs? And how are you supposed to get one alone long enough to ask them?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"He's back! He's back! Voldemort's back! Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him... not there!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire. You bewitched Krum but...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Bloody hell.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Loads. According to dad. It's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"Murder me, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"[bitterly] That's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Piss off.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"[To Harry] Go on, Harry. Harry, for goodness sake."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,[To Harry] I'm not an owl!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. ""Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey, sources report, is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow."""
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"I won't be going alone, because believe it or not, someone's asked me! And I said yes!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"[To Ron] Next time there's a ball, pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does! And not i the last resort!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"How fastidious you've become, Wormtail. As I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home. Could it be the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,No! The boy is everything! It cannot be done without him. And it will be done exactly as I said.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker is standing just outside the door.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"Harry, at last!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,Kill the spare.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"The other arm, Wormtail."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"[The Death Eaters appear] Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet, here you stand before me, as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself... disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. [He unmasks the Death Eaters one by one and as he does they fall to their knees] Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you, Lucius. [He pulls off Lucius' mask who falls to his knees]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"Harry. I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you, but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The Boy-Who-Lived. How lies have fed your legend, Harry! Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? Yes, shall I? It was love. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son, she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch him. It was old magic. Something I should have foreseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed. I CAN TOUCH YOU NOW! [He places his finger on Harry's forehead lightning bolt scar, and Harry immediately screams out in agony, to Voldemort's cruel delight] Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"(as he roughly releases the scythe) Pick up your wand, Potter! I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up! (Harry gets his wand) You've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes? First, we bow to each other. (he bows, Harry does not) Come on now, Harry. The niceties must be observed. Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he? I said, BOW! (uses a curse to make Harry bow) That's better, and now: Crucio! (Harry writhes on the grass in pain) Crucio! (the curse goes away) Attaboy, Harry! Your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy Muggle mother!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you. (leans down to meet Harry's eyes) After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you, they'll speak only of how you begged for death... and I, being a merciful Lord, obliged. Get up! (Harry groans)"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,"(as he fires the Killing Curse at the tombstone; shouting) Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! I want you to look at me when I kill you! I WANT TO SEE THE LIGHT LEAVE YOUR EYES!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort,[To the onlooking Death Eaters during Priori Incantatem] Do nothing! He's mine to finish!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice, between what is right and what is easy."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"I keep looking for some mistake, some sign, some clue as to why these terrible things are happening, but everytime I get close to an answer, IT SLIPS AWAY, it's maddening."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"[Enters the tent of the First Task] Welcome today, champions. Now you've waited, you've wondered, and finally, the moment has arrived. A moment only four of you can fully appreciate. [notices that it's Hermione whose shoulders he has his arm around] What are you doing here, Miss Granger?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"[In the great hall speaking to the staff and students; his eulogy for Cedric] Today... we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know, exceptionally hard-working, infinitely fair-minded, and a fierce, fierce friend. Now I believe you all have the right to know exactly how he died. (getting up) You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered, by Lord Voldemort! The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this, but not doing so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now, the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me... reminds us, that though we may come from different places, and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. The bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. You remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You remember that, and we will celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and fair and true, right to the very end."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius,"""Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig. Ever since the World Cup, the Ministrys been intercepting more and more owls and shes too easily recognized.

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius,"Look Harry, the death eaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet, these aren't just coincidences, Hogwarts isn't safe anymore."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius,"I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius,"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Myrtle," I was circling a blocked drain the other day. I could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion. (flirtily) Not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Wormtail," Bone of the father, unwillingly given. (puts the Riddle bone in the cauldron) Flesh of the servant... willingly sacrificed. (screams in agony as he cuts off his own hand) Blood of the enemy... (as he cuts Harry's sleeve and draws blood as Harry screams in pain) forcibly taken. The Dark Lord shall rise again. (adds the blood to the cauldron; it boils and Harry screams)"

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, Harry.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Ah.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, Harry! You alright?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Hermione! Bad dream. When did you get here?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," Just now, you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Last night.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, Bloody hell!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," Honestly get dressed! And don't go back to sleep. Come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast is ready."

Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," [standing below them] Well, put it this way; If it rains, youll be the first to know."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy, Father and I are in the Minister's box. A personal invitation from Cornelius Fudge himself!

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Three, sir."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [Writes ""Unforgiveable"" on a blackboard] And they are so named?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will...
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [finishing her sentence] Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now, the Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I SAY DIFFERENT! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be prepared! [Seamus takes some gum out and puts it under his desk] You need to find another place to put your chewing gum besides the under-side of your desk, MR.

Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, my dad did tell me about one. The Imperius Curse."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) Oh, yeah. Your father would know all about that. Gave the Ministry a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding...under the influence of the Imperius Curse. But here's the rub
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," [Nervously] There's the, um, the Cruciatus Curse."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) Correct! Correct! Come, come. [the spider comes back] Particularly nasty. The torture curse. [Aims his wand at the spider] Crucio!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him?! Stop it!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [Releases the spider from the curse; Walks over and places the spider on Hermione's desk] Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable curse, Miss Granger. [Hermione shakes her head] No? [Points his wand at the spider] Avada Kedavra! [The spider falls, unmarked but dead. Harry is watching from a desk across.] The Killing Curse. [looks at Harry] Only one person is known to have survived it...and he's sitting in this room."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Olympe Maxime," It's wrong, I tell you!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff, You French tart! Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, Quiet! I can't think!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Karkaroff, Everything is a conspiracy theory!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Maxime, I protest!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Harry!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Maxime, I protest!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Harry. [Grabs him] Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, sir."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, sir."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, You're absolutely sure?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yes. Yes, sir."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Maxime, But of course he is lying!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr., (as Mad-Eye Moody) The hell he is! The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth-year!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Karkaroff," You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) [threateningly] It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff. Perhaps you remember?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," [enraged, walking between them] This doesn't help, Alastor! Leave this to you, Barty."
Wiki,Slytherin,"Movie_Barty Crouch, Sr."," The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight... a Triwizard champion."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," This can't go on, Albus. First the Dark Mark, now this?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," What do you suggest, Minerva?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, You heard Barty. The rules are clear.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Well, the devil with Barty - and his rules. And since when did you accommodate the Ministry?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," Headmaster, I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events, perhaps we should, for the time being... let them unfold."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," What? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I agree... with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) I can do that.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Don't let him know, though. He must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita Skeeter, This is cozy.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's a broom cupboard.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita," You should feel right at home then. [Forces Harry to a lower part of the cupboard] Don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh. Uh, no."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita," So tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of twelve--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm fourteen. Sorry.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita," About to compete against three students, not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but to have mastered spells you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I-I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. [looks at the quill, which is writing on its own]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita," Just ignore the quill. Then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of twelve, are you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [miffed] Fourteen.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita, Your story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I didn't enter.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Rita," Of course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. [To the quill] Scratch that last. [the quill obeys] Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows, at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic death wish?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [looks at the quill's notes] Hey! My eyes aren't ""glistening with the ghosts of my past""!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sirius. How?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," I don't have much time, Harry, so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Shh! I had to ask. Now tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I don't know.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, You didn't hear a name?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, And what was that?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," He wanted... me. I don't know why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Yes... it's just a dream. Look, Harry, the Death Eaters at the World Cup; your name rising from that goblet; these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What are you saying?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff? He was a Death Eater and no one, no one stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his own son to Azkaban."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet, Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I'm not ready for this, Sirius."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, You don't have a choice.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Someone's coming.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Keep your friends close, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid is looking for you.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Is that right? Well... You can tell him... Wait... What?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [Goes back to Ron, talks to him quietly for a few seconds, then walks back] Dean was told by Parvati that... that... Please don't ask me to say it again! Hagrid is looking for you. [starts to walk away]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Well you can tell Ronald
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [furiously] I'M NOT AN OWL!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five! [laughs]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [enraged] I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy! He's vile, and cruel... and you're just pathetic."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, Pathetic?! [angrily draws his wand]
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) OH NO, YOU DON'T, SONNY! [Transfigures Draco into a ferret] I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned! [Proceeds to flick the ferret up and down] You stinking...cowardly...scummy...back-shooting--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, Professor Moody! Wha-what are you doing?!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Teaching.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall, [shocked] Is that a... Is that a student?!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) Technically, it's a ferret. [Proceeds to dump the ferret down Crabbe's trousers]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Goyle," Stand still! Stand still! [Attempts to remove the ferret from Crabbe's trousers, only to be bitten]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco, [Getting up] My father will hear about this!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) Is that a threat?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonnagall, Professor Moody--
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) IS THAT A THREAT?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonnagall, Professor--
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch," (as Mad-Eye) I CAN TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT YOUR FATHER THAT WILL CURL EVEN YOUR GREASY HAIR, BOY!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonnagall, Alastor!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) IT DOESN'T END HERE!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Alastor. [Moody listens] We never use Transfiguration as a punishment! Surely, Dumbledore told you that?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) He might've mentioned it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Well, you will do well to remember it. [She turns around, before gesturing a group of students gathered nearby to leave] Away!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Crouch, (as Mad-Eye) You. Come with me.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your name in the Goblet of Fire.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Caught on, have you? Took you long enough."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, I'm the not only who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [sarcastic] Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Least I warned you about the dragons.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," No, no, no. I did. No, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you, Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be all right, you know, after you'd figured that out."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [confused] ...Who? Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yeah. Isn't it? I suppose I was a bit distraught.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [sadly] Boys.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," The house of Godric Gryffindor has been a beacon in the wizarding world for nearly ten centuries, and I will not have you besmirching it in one night by acting like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George/Fred," [to each other] Try saying that five times fast. [together] Babbling, bumbling band of baboons! Babbling, bumbling band of baboons! Babbling... [Both walk off screen]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," [About the Yule Ball] Inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers, longing to burst forth and take flight."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [To Seamus] Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [To Fred and George]] Oi! [They lean in to him] You're never gonna let him forget this, are you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What are those?! What are those?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, My dress robes.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, they're all right! No lace, no dodgy little collar..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, I expect yours are more... traditional"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati, [Looking at Hermione] She looks beautiful!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [Looking at Cho] Yeah, she does... Wha [Turns around and sees Hermione coming down the stairs. Noticing how beautiful she really looks, he smiles gently, agreeing with Parvati]"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dumstrang Boy, [To Parvati] May I have your arm?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Parvati, [looks back at Harry then says to the boy] Arm? Leg? I'm yours! [goes to dance with him]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [about Krum] Hes using you.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," How dare you! Besides, I can take care of myself."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Doubt it, hes way too old."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What? Is that what you think?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Yeah, thats what I think!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [on the verge of tears] You know the solution then, dont you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Go on.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Next time theres a ball, pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Well... that-that-that... thats just completely off the point. [sees Harry approaching] Harry.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Where have you been? Never mind. Off to bed, both of you!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, They get scary when they get older.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Ron, you spoiled EVERYTHING!! [Breaks down in tears on the stairs]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [catching on his meaning] Wouldn't know, we don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [desperately trying to recover] I just mean he's not particularly loquacious. [Harry looks at her in amusement] Mostly, he watches me study. It's a bit annoying, actually."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus, What's the matter with him?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dean, I don't know. I can't see him.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville[Horrified], Oh my God! I've killed Harry Potter!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fleur Delacour," You saved her, even though she was not yours to save. My little sister. Thank you! [kisses Harry on both cheeks before turning to Ron] And you, you helped."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Yeah, yeah, a bit. [Fleur kisses Ron on both cheeks as well before checking on her little sister] Merci."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Personally, I believe you behaved admirably."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I finished last, Hermione."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Next to last. Fleur never got past ""ze Grindylows."""
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr.," Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this council. Should your testimony prove consequential, Council may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain, in the eyes of the Ministry, a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," I do, sir."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., And what do you wish to present?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," I have names, sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., Mr. Rosier is dead.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff, Dead?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Alastor Moody," [to Dumbledore] Yeah, he took a piece of me with him, though, didn't he?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff, I didn't know.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., If that is all the witness has to offer...
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," Ya ya, the same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr.," Very well, the council will deliberate. In the meantime you will return to Azkaban."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," NO! WAIT! WAIT! PLEASE! PLEASE!. I have more! What about Snape, Severus Snape?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," The council is very much aware of given evidence to this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater, and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff, [with demented fury] It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr.," Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence, this session is now concluded."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I heard about one more."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., What's that?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff, The name...
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., Yes?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," I know for a fact that this person took part in the capture, and by means of the Cruciatus curse, torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife..."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., The name. Give me the wretched name!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Igor Karkaroff," Barty Crouch! [Rita Skeeter gasps, pause] Junior."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr.," Get your filthy hands off of me, you pathetic little men! [He is brought before his father] Hello, father. [flicks his tongue]"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Bartemius Crouch Sr., [visibly hurt] You are no son of mine.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," A rather rare herb, gillyweed. Not something found in your everyday garden. Nor is this. [He faces Harry and holds up a small bottle of a clear liquid] Know what it is?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Bubble juice, sir?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I haven't stolen anything.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Don't... lie to me. Gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies? You and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me, I'm going to find out why!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," [to the Death Eaters] Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet, here you stand as if it were only yesterday. I confess myself... disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. [angrily starts ripping off their masks] Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you, Lucius."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," My Lord, had I detected any sign; a whisper of your whereabouts--"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Oh, there were signs, my slippery friend, and more than whispers!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways! The face I have been obliged to present since your... absence  that is my true mask."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_James Potter," Harry, when the connection is broken you must get to the Portkey! We can linger for a moment to give you some time but only a moment. Do you understand?"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cedric Diggory," Harry. Take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my father."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lily Potter," Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go... LET GO!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge, For God sake's Dumbledore what's happened?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [Crying over Cedric's body] He's back! He's back! Voldemort's back! Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him... not there!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," It's all right, Harry...it's all right. He's home, you both are."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Cornelius Fudge," [rushing over to Snape and McGonagall] Keep everybody in their seats. A boys just been killed. The body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Amos Diggory," [Pushing his way frantically through the crowd] Let me through. LET ME THROUGH! Let me through, THAT'S MY SON! That's my boy! [pushes Harry's hands away and leans over Cedric's body, sobbing hysterically] IT'S MY BOY!!!!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr.," (as Mad-Eye) [mocking Hagrid] ""Marvelous creatures, Dragons, aren't they"". Do you think that miserable oaf would've sent you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater if I hadn't told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder, could've provided you with Gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book that led him straight to it? HUH?! [Points to head with finger, as if to say, ""Use your brain""]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It was you from the beginning! You put my name into the Goblet of Fire! You bewitched Krum! But--
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr.," (as Mad-Eye) [Mocking] ""Bu-bu-bu-bu"". You won because I made it so, Potter. You ended up in that graveyard because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. [Grabs Harry's bleeding arm] The blood that runs in your veins runs within the Dark Lord! Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," You alright, Alastor?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody," I'm sorry, Albus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, If that's Moody then who's
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Polyjuice Potion.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Now we know who's been stealing it from your store, Severus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Barty Crouch Jr.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr., I'll show you mine if you show me yours. [He reveals the Death-Eater symbol on his wrist]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Your arm, Harry. [shows the scar on Harry's wrist  where Wormtail took his blood to revive Voldemort is shown]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr.," You know what this means, don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, [to Snape] Send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Barty Crouch Jr., [smugly] I'll be welcomed back like a hero!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Perhaps. Personally, I've never had much time for heroes."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry And Hermione, No!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh well, what's life without a few dragons?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Everything's going to change now, isn't it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Yes.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Promise you'll write this summer, both of you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oh, I won't. You know I won't."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Harry will, won't you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yeah, every week."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[Addressing Dumbledore's Army] Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself. Think of it this way; every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[after Dumbledore announced Umbridge the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, whispering to Hermione] She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Rubeus Hagrid," Its changin out there. Theres a storm comin, arry... just like last time. And we'd all best be ready when she does."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Sybill Trelawney," [goes into a trance, makes a prediction] The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not... For neither can live while the other s-survives."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Kingsley Shacklebolt," You may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Where are we going? The letter said I had been expelled from Hogwarts.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody," Well, you haven't been. Not yet. [to Shacklebolt] Kingsley, you take point."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But the letter said--
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Kingsley, [interrupting Harry] Dumbledore has persuaded the Minister to suspend your expulsion pending a formal hearing.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, A hearing?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Kingsley, Uh-huh.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Tonks," Don't worry, Harry. we'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody," Sshh! Not here, Nymphadora!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Tonks, [her hair turns red and then back to her original color] Don't call me Nymphadora!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody, Stay in formation everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Molly," He's not an adult either. He's not James, Sirius."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, He's not your son.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Molly, He's as good as. Who else has he got?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, Ginny."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, He's got me!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," How touching and paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," Now you stay out of this, Snivellus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Snape's part of the Order?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Git.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, I don't care what Dumbledore says about your supposed reformation. I know better.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Why don't you tell him? Or are you afraid he won't take serious the word of a man hiding in his mother's house?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hermione, I hate your cat."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Bad Crookshanks!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur," This is very, very peculiar. It seems that your hearing at the Minstry is to be before the entire Wizengamot."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I don't understand, what's the Ministry of Magic got against me?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody, Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet, to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin, The Minister thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, But that's insane. No one in their right mind could believe that Dumbledore--
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power, he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned and I'm afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing that terrifying truth."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. [everyone turns to face Sirius] Fourteen years ago he had huge numbers at his command, not only witches and wizards but all sorts of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. [Moody lets out a loud cough] We believe Voldemort may be after something else--"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody, Sirius--
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, Something he didn't have last time.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You mean, a weapon?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Molly, No! That's enough! He's just a boy! You tell him much more and you might as well induct him in the Order straight away!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Good! I want to join! If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian... Dumbledore."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," You, you got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. [Pause] The charges?"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," The charges against the accused are as follows; that he did knowingly and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, produced a Patronus charm in the presence of a Muggle. Do you deny producing said Patronus?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, I--"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge, [interrupting Harry] And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yes, but--"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge, Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I was only doing it because of the Dementors!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Amelia Bones, Dementors? In Little Whinging?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they boy? Highly convenient."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm not lying! There were two of them and if I hadn't--
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," [Interrupting Harry again] Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well rehearsed story, but since you can produce no witnesses of the event--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Pardon me Minister, but as it happens, we can."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Amelia Bones, Please describe the attack. What did they look like?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Mrs. Figg," Well one of them was very large, and the other rather skinny."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," Not the boys, the Dementors!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Mrs. Figg," Alright, right, well um, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold, as though all the happiness had gone from the world."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," Now look here, Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb and happen across a wizard, the odds are astronomical."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I don't think anyone would believe the Dementors were there by coincidence, Minister."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," [clears her throat] I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor. Dementors are after all under the control of the Ministry of Magic. So silly of me but it sounded, for a moment, as though you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Undersecretary, which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry into why the two Dementors were so far away from Azkaban and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence of the Dark Lord's return is incontrovertible."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge, He's not back!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," In the matter of Harry Potter, the law clearly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Clearly, it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of under-age magic."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Amelia Bones, Those in favor of conviction? [Fudge raises his hand followed by some other people including Umbridge] Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge, [reluctantly; as he bangs his gavel] Cleared of all charges.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [sees a strange reptilian-like thestrals] What is it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What's what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That. Pulling the carriage.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself like always."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," You're not going mad. [lowers her magazine, The Quibbler, which she has been reading upside down] I see them too. You're just as sane as I am."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me. [No one smiles] I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred And George, [sarcastically] That's likely.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizard of vital importance. Although each Headmaster has brought something new to this historic school... [nods to Dumbledore] progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected and prune practices that ought to be prohibited."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Thank you Professor Umbridge, that really was most illuminating."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Illuminating? What a load o' waffle!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Dean, Seamus, good holiday?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dean," Alright, better than Seamus' anyway."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus, Me mam didn't want me to come back this year.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why not?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," [sarcastically] Let me see, eh, because of you! The Daily Prophet's been sayin a lot of things about ya, Harry. And about Dumbledore as well."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," What, your mum believes them?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," Well, nobody was there the night Cedric died."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [increasingly angry] Oh, well, I guess you should read the Prophet then, like your stupid mother, it'll tell you everything you need to know!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus, Don't you dare talk about my mother like that!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [entering the Common Room] What's going on?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus," He's mad, is what's goin on! Do you believe the rubbish he's comin out with about You-Know-Who?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Yeah, I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? [Harry has stormed into the boys' dorm - Ron hot on his tail - and is starting to get ready for bed] You alright?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Fine.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Seamus was bang out of order, mate. But he'll come through. You'll see--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I said I'm fine, Ron!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [taken aback] Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts then. [leaves the dormitory]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, So why can't the others see them?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, They can only be seen by people who've seen death.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, So... you've known someone who's died?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment, and one day one of her spells went badly wrong. I was nine."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm sorry.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and you fought him and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you and Dumbledore."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What do you mean?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," Well, if I were You-Know-Who, I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone, you're not as much of a threat."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Your previous instruction for this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you will be pleased to know, from now on you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic. [Hermione raises her hand] Yes?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Using spells? [laughs] Why I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, We're not gonna use magic?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure risk-free way.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, what use is that? If we're gonna be attacked, it won't be risk-free."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. [pauses] It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient to get you through your examinations, which after all is what school is all about!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, And hows theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," There is nothing out there, dear. Who would you imagine would want to attack children like yourself?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [sarcastically] Oh, I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Now let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark Wizard is at large once again. This... is... a... lie!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's not a lie! I saw him! I fought him!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," DETENTION, Mr. Potter!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, So according to you Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [angrily] It was murder! Voldemort killed him! You must know!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," ENOUGH! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. [giggles]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What's wrong with your hand?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Nothing. [shows her his right hand]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Your other hand. [grabs his left arm, and sees his scars from Umbridge's detention] [horrified] You've got to tell Dumbledore!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Bloody hell, Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this-!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yeah, well, I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Harry, you've got to report this. It's perfectly simple - you're being-"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this, it's not simple. You don't understand."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [frustrated] Then help us to.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students, you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," So silly of me but it sounds as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom, Minerva."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Not at all, Dolores. Merely your medieval methods."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," I am sorry dear, but to question my practices is to question the Ministry and, by extension, the Minister himself. I am a tolerant woman, but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall, Disloyalty?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," [during an inspection] So, you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Yes.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, But you were unsuccessful?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, [annoyed] Obviously.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Trelawney, [in tears] Sixteen years I've lived and taught here! Hogwarts is my home! You can't do this!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," [shows the Order of Dismissal to Trelawney with faux sympathy] Actually, I can. [McGonagall arrives and tries to comfort Trelawney] [to McGonagall] Something you'd like to say, dear?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Oh, there are several things I would like to say!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," [arrives] Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," [to Trelawney] Sybil, dear, this way..."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Trelawney," [shakes Dumbledore's hand] Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms of Educational Decree #23, as enacted by the Minister..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," [warningly] You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds - That power remains with the headmaster."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, For now.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, [turns around to the students and speaks sternly] Don't you all have studying to do?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, First we need to find a place to practice where Umbridge won't find out.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny, The Shrieking Shack?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's too small.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Forbidden Forest?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Not bloody likely!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny, Harry? What happens if Umbridge does find out?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Who cares? I mean, sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [pleasantly surprised] Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, The what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," It's also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it, and is always equipped for the seeker's needs."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," So, say you really needed the toilet...?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's the idea."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's brilliant! It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Um... Hi! You all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Zacharias, Why?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Why. Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Zacharias, [nods toward Harry] So he says.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, So Dumbledore says.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Zacharias," So Dumbledore says because he says! The point is, where's the proof?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Boy, If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I'm not going to talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here you might as well clear out now. [aside to Hermione] C'mon, Hermione, let's go. They're just here because they think I'm some sort of freak."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Harry, wait!"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, Is it true you can produce a Patronus charm?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Yes. I've seen it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dean," Blimey, Harry! I didn't know you could do that!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny, It's true.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Third year he fought off about a hundred dementors at once.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, And last year he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Wait... look, it all sounds great when you say it like that. But the truth is most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I nearly always had help..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, He's just being modest.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, Hermione, I'm not! Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake you can just try again tomorrow. But out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes... you don't know what that's like."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're having any chance against beating... Voldemort."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Nigel, He's really back?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Don't worry, I'll go easy on you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [sarcastically] Thanks, Ronald."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, One Sickle.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, You're on.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, Thank you.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Shut up.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Are you alright? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Cho," Yeah, I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, just learning all this. Makes me wonder whether if he'd known it..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Cedric, Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Cho," You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. [Mistletoe magically appears above Cho and Harry] Mistletoe."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Probably full of Nargles, though."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Cho, What are Nargles?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No idea.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [referring to Harry's kiss] Well, how was it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Wet. Well, she was sort of... crying."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," That bad at it, are you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I'm sure Harry's kissing is more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Don't you understand how she must be feeling? [Ron and Harry just stare at her] Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him. Conflicted because Umbridge is threatening to sack her mother from her job at the Ministry and frightened of failing her O.W.L.'s because she's so busy worrying about everything else."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [after a long pause] One person couldn't feel all that, they'd explode!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... [laughs]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," In the dream were you standing next to the victim, or looking down at the scene?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Neither, I--It was like I--Professor, will you please just tell me what's happening?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Everard! Arthur is on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sir...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Phineas! You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured and his children will be arriving there soon, by Portkey."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Everard," They got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. Once more the Dark Lord failed to acquire it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Oh, thank goodness! Next we need to--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [enraged] LOOK AT ME! [Dumbledore finally faces Harry] What's happening to me?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," [Entering Dumbledore's office] You wished to see me, Headmaster?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Oh Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise we'll all be vulnerable.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," It appears there is a connection between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is for the moment unclear. Pray he remains ignorant."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You mean if he knows about it then, he'll be able to read my mind?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Read it, control it, unhinge it. In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them literally begging for death would he finally kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself! Legilimens! [Series of flashbacks] Concentrate, Potter. Focus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [to Sirius] This connection between me and Voldemort, what if the reason for it is that I'm becoming more like him? [starts to choke up; fighting back tears] I just feel so... angry, all the time. And what if after everything I've been through, something's gone wrong inside me. What if I'm becoming bad?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius," I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. You understand? [Harry nods] Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We have all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on. That's who we really are."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid, Dumbledore sent me to parlay with the giants.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Giants?! You found them?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid," Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, you see."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," [talking to Harry alone] Fourteen years ago, a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information, but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," I've been watching them for weeks and see, Dumbledore's Army. Proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. [to Dumbledore] All your fear mongering about You-Know-Who never fooled us for a minute. We see your lies for what they were, a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Naturally.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No, professor! He had nothing to do with it, it was me!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as it's been pointed out the parchment clearly says ""Dumbledore's Army"", not ""Potter's"". I instructed Harry to form this organization and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge," Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry we can still make the front page. Dawlish, Shacklebolt! You will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban, to await trial for conspiracy and sedition..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Ah, I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion I am going to - what was the phrase, ""Come quietly""? Well I can tell you this"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Enough of this! Take him!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Kingsley," Whoo! You may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny - Dumbledore's got style! [Fudge gives Kingsley a WTF look]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Yeah, we talked you into it..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is made things worse. Anyway, it doesn't matter anymore, because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much - The more you care, the more you have to lose. Maybe, it's just best to..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, To what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, To go it alone.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Feeling sentimental?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That's private.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Don't say a word against my father.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Weak!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I'm not weak!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Then prove it! Control your emotions! Discipline your mind! Legilimens!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry (In Memory), Sirius.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, I may vomit.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Stop it!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Is that what you call control?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [heavy panting] We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind, sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that, in fact he frequently saw to it!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, My father was a great man!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Your father was a swine. Legilimens!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Protego!
Wiki,Gryffindor,"Movie_James ""Prongs"" Potter"," Come on, Moony! Padfoot! Snape! [points his wand at Snape] Expelliarmus!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,"Movie_Sirius ""Padfoot"" Black Iii"," Nice one, James!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Young Marauder," Come on, James, finish him off!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, [shocked] Dad?
Wiki,Gryffindor,"Movie_James ""Prongs"" Potter"," Impedimenta! (Hogwartians start to chant ""Snivellus! Greasy! Snivellus! Greasy!"") [smirks] Right, who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Enough. [grabs Harry by his shirt] Your lessons are at an end.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I didn't mean--
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Get. Out.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, I need that prophecy.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, You'll have to kill me.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Oh I will, but first you will fetch it for me. Crucio! Crucio!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [to Ron and Hermione] Alert the Order if you can.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Are you mental? We're going with you!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's too dangerous.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, When are you going to get it into your head?! We're in this together!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, [Catching them] That you are!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," You sent for me, Headmistress?"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether they want to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," I'm afraid you used up all my stores, interrogating students. The last of it on Ms. Chang. Unless you wish to poison him - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy if you did - I cannot help you. [turns to leave]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [to Snape; desperately] He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, No idea. [leaves without another word]
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is a matter of Ministry Security, you leave me with... no other alternative. The Cruiciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, That's illegal.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, [Putting a picture of Fudge face down] What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. [prepares to curse Harry]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Tell her, Harry!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Tell me what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Well, if you won't tell her where it is, I will."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Where what is?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Dumbledore's secret weapon.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. [A centaur takes out an arrow and places in on his bow] Lower your weapons! I warn you! Under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence-- [The centaur fires its arrow] Protego! [makes a shield and the arrow falls on the ground] How dare you! Filthy halfbreed! Incarcerous!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Please, please stop it! Please!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," NO, ENOUGH! I will have order! [Umbridge is picked up by Grawpy] YOU FILTHY ANIMAL! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [To the centaurs] Leave him alone! It's not his fault! He doesn't understand!
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," Potter, do something! Tell them I mean no harm!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I'm sorry, Professor. But I must not tell lies."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, [as the centaurs carry her away] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge! LET... ME... GOOOOOOOOOOO!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Thank you, Grawp."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [Running up with Harry to meet Ginny, Ron, Neville and Luna] How did you get away?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," Puking Pastilles, it wasn't pretty."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I told them I was hungry and wanted some sweets. Of course they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [surprised] That was clever, Ron!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [smiles] It's been known to happen.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," It was brilliant. So, how are we getting to London?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you. But, I've got you into enough trouble as it is."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Dumbledore's Army was supposed to be about doing something real. Or was all that just words to you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," So, how are we going to get to London?"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," We fly, of course."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Where's Sirius?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams and reality. You only saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now hand me the prophecy."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, You do anything to us and I'll break it.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange," [laughs] He knows how to play! Itty, bitty, baby, Potter!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, Neville Longbottom is it? How's mum and dad?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville, Better. [points wand] now they're about to be avenged!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, All we want is that prophecy.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," It's alright, he's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. [whispers] Haven't you always wondered what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you, when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do, is give it to me, and I can show you everything."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I waited 14 years.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, [in mock sympathy] I know.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Guess I can wait a little longer. NOW!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," Did you actually believe, or were you truly naive enough to think that children stood a chance, against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now, or watch your friends die."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville," Don't give it to him, Harry!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, Sst!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius, Get away from my godson. [punches Lucius]
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, [Laughing] I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me?!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, CRUCIO!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," [Inside Harry's head] You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. [Voldemort appears behind Harry] Do it! [Harry turns around and is easily disarmed by Voldemort] So weak!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, By which time I shall be gone. And you... shall be dead.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [While being possessed by Voldemort] You... you've lost, old man!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Harry.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort, So weak! So vulnerable! Look at me!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not! [Pause] Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"You're the weak one. And you'll never know love, or friendship. And I feel sorry for you."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Fudge, He's back!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, I know how you feel Harry.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No you don't. It's my fault.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year, he'd be less tempted and therefore you might be more protected."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, The prophecy said
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Yes.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Why didn't you tell me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. For the same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you suffered, I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, How come you're not at the feast?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, That's awful.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. [holds Harry's hand for a few seconds, then releases it]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Are you sure you don't want any help looking?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," That's alright. Anyway, my mum always said, things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end... [They see shoes hanging at the ceiling] if not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, What's that?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," That even though we got a fight ahead of us, we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Yeah?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Something worth fighting for.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[after Dumbledore asks him if he has feelings for Hermione] Oh no, no, no, I mean she's brilliant, but we're friends."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's... it's the place to be tonight!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,[After witnessing Dumbledore's murder] Snape! He trusted you!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,Being me has its privileges.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore,"Now as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight and you have the right to know why. Once there was a young man, who like you, sat in this very hall, walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roofs. He seemed to all the world a student like any other. His name: Tom Riddle. [Murmuring erupts among the students] Today, of course, he's known all over the world by another name, which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact: Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. [pause] But in the end, their greatest weapon... is you. There's something to think about. Now off to bed, pip pip."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy,"Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! [Harry falls, still hidden] Oh, right. She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. [Kicks Harry in the face, breaking his nose] That's for my father. [Covers Harry with the cloak] Enjoy your trip back to London."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Horace Slughorn,"[in regard to returning to Hogwarts] All right, I'll do it! But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise, these are mad times we live in. MAD!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Horace Slughorn,"[Telling Harry the story of his deceased fish] It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk with just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. Just before it reached the bottom, it was transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day the bowl was empty, was the day your mother... I know why you're here, but I can't help you. It would ruin me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Professor Mcgonagall," Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Arthur Weasley," Times like these, dark times, they do funny things to people. They can tear them apart."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood," I've never been to this part of the castle. Well, not when I'm awake. I sleep-walk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Katie Bell," I know you're going to ask Harry, but I don't know who cursed me. Ive been trying to remember, honestly. But I just cant."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Muggle Waitress, Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No one, bit of a tosser really."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Muggle Waitress," Funny that paper of yours, a couple minutes ago I could have sworn I saw a picture move. Thought I was going 'round a twist."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hey, I was wondering--"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Muggle Waitress, 11. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I just Apparated, didn't I?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit their first time.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Can't imagine why...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," You are, of course, wondering why it is I have brought you here tonight."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sorta go with it."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Merlin's Beard! No need to disfigure me, Albus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, It's all in the upholstery. [pats his stomach] I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, [points to stains in room] Dragon's blood.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," So what's with all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't by any chance waiting for someone else, were you?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean... Oh alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year, you know what that's like? You can only say no to these people so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, How much for this?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred And George, Five Galleons.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, How much for me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred And George, Five Galleons.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I'm your brother!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred And George, Ten Galleons.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sorry I made you miss the carriages by the way, Luna."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, That's alright. It was like being with a friend.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, I am your friend, Luna."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, That's nice.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," [regarding Harry's broken nose] Would you like me to fix that for you? I think you look a little devil-may-care this way, but it's up to you..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Um... have you fixed a nose before?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna," No, but I've done several toes. How different are they, really?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," ...Okay, yeah, sure, give it a go."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, Episkey!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Augh...!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Well? How do I look?
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna, Exceptionally ordinary.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, ...Brilliant.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [to Hermione and Ginny] Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute. [starts eating]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [smacks him on the arm with a book] Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Oi. Turn around, you lunatic!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny, He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Looks like it's his own this time.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I'm like you, Tom. I'm different."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 11, Prove it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Did you know, sir? Then?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," What about you, Miss Granger? What do your parents do in the Muggle world?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, My parents are dentists. [Everyone except Harry looks at her in confusion] They tend to people's teeth.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No... Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," What brings you here, sir?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," [good-naturedly/drunkenly] Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back! Farther back than I care to admit! Ho ho ho... Why I can remember when it was just ONE Broomstick! [Slughorn chuckles and spills his drink all over the table, splashing Hermione; she jumps away] Whoops! All hands on deck, there, Granger!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," [to Harry, Ron, and Hermione] Why is it, whenever something happens, it is always you three?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Believe me, Professor, Ive been asking myself the same question for six years."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It was Malfoy.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," That is a very serious accusation, Potter!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Indeed. Your evidence?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I just know.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," You just know? [pause] Once again you astonish with your gifts Potter, gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be... to be the Chosen One."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [about Ginny and Dean] What is it he sees in her?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, She's smart... funny... attractive...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Attractive?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Well you know... she has nice... skin.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, Skin. So you think Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, no, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Hermione's got nice skin. You know, as skin goes, I mean."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I-I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. [long pause] ...I think I'll be going to sleep now."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Some of your classmates... well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Shelf, sir?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Anyone who aspires to be anyone ends up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? [Slughorn freezes] You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst he was here at Hogwarts.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," What was he like? [no response] I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," I... of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [To Harry] You really shouldn't have done it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game. [Harry takes the vial of Felix Felicis out of his shirt pocket and shows it to Hermione, who looks at it in confusion] You didn't put it in. Ron only thought you did."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [Tearfully] Charms spell. I'm just practicing.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well, they're really good. [sits down]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lavender, Oops! I think this room's taken! [runs off]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, What's with the birds?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Oppugno.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It feels like this.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [about Romilda Vane] She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," But I am the Chosen One. [Hermione hits on the head with a rolled up newspaper.] Sorry, um, kidding."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Waiter, Dragon Tartare?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No, Im fine, thank you."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Waiter," Probably just as well, they give one horrible breath."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," On second thoughts... [Grabs tray and gobbles one] Maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay... oh God, here he comes!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I think she just went to powder her nose.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mclaggen," Slippery little minx your friend is. Likes to work her mouth, too, doesnt she?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mclaggen," What is this I'm eating, by the way?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [tentative] Dragon Balls.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," [pause] You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen - [Harry tries to leave] not... so quick, Potter!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date..."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," Can surely survive another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Message?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holiday. You see, hes traveling, and he wont return until term resumes."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Traveling where?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," [taking a mince pie from the plate on her lap] Open up, you. [Smiling broadly as he looks surprised] Don't you trust me? [she feeds him the mince pie]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It's good...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [as he is sitting down] Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah. [Offering the platter] Pie?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [curtly] Not for me, no."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny, Has Ron gone to bed?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Um... [looks upstairs] not yet, no."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," [indicating his feet] Shoelace. [Harry bends down to re-tie his shoelaces, but Ginny gets there first. When she has finished, she straightens up and moves closer to him.] Merry Christmas, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Merry Christmas.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," [To Tom] I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. [Someone in Tom's gang laughs]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite. But how did you know?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16, Intuition.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Good gracious, is it that time, already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. [Everyone but Tom leaves. Tom taps the hourglass, and Slughorn notices Tom is still there] Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," Yes, sir. You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, Go on.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic, and I thought, perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... [He makes an unintelligible sound and Slughorn stares in bewilderment.]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Now get out of here at once AND DON'T EVER LET ME CATCH YOU MENTIONING IT AGAIN! [The memory becomes cloudy and ends]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," Close your eyes. That way you cant be tempted. [she hides the Half-Blood Prince's book, then kisses Harry] That can stay hidden up here too, if you like."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," So, did you and Ginny do it, then?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [alarmed] What?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You know, hide the book?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Oh... yeah.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lavender, [noticing Hermione at Ron's side in the Hospital Wing] What's she doing here!?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I might ask you the same question!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lavender, I happen to be his girlfriend!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I happen to be his... friend.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lavender, Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks! I suppose you want to make up now that he's suddenly all interesting!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lavender," Ah! See? He senses my presence. [leans down] Don't worry, Won-Won! I'm here. I'm here."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [croaks] Uh... Hermione... Her... my... nee. Hermione...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," [jovially] Oh, to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away everyone... Mr. Weasley is well tended."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," [whispering to Harry] About time, too. Don't you think?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [To Madam Pomfrey as she puts something on Ron's bedside table] Thank you.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [noticing Harry's expression] Oh, shut up."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," [Gasps in surprise] Merlin's beard, Harry!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, sorry, sir, I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Yes, I did actually! ...What made you think that?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Oh, well, just the general behavior, sir - the sneaking around, jumping when you saw me... Are those tentacular leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer! ...Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Personally, these plants always kind of freak me out."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," That would be counter-productive, sir!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, What makes you say that?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No idea.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I'm going to tell you something - something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One, only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office, and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, sir. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise the bowl will remain empty, forever."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Please... don't think badly of me when you see it. You've no idea how he was like, even then. [Withdraws memory]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," [approaching Slughorn] I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted Section, and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, I beg your pardon?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16, A Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark indeed."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16, Which is why I came to you.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, [Stares at Tom for a second] A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," But I don't understand how that works, sir."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," One splits ones soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16, Protected?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," That part of your soul that is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," [Looks into the fireplace] And how does one split his soul, sir?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," I think you already know the answer to that, Tom."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16, Murder.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn, Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It's a violation against nature.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," [Adjusting ring on his finger, the same one in present day Dumbledore's office] Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven..."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Slughorn," Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Tom Riddle - Age 16," [Smiling] Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine, spring evening?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, Who else is here? I heard you talking.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you been whispering to you yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, How do you know what I am?! I've done things that would shock you!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that, in return, she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco, but I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak that your heart can't really have been in them."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, He trusts me! I was chosen! [reveals the Dark Mark on his left arm]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, I shall make it easy for you... [raises his wand]
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, Expelliarmus!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," [wand flies out of his hand] Very good, very good. [door opens in the distance] You're not alone? There are others? How?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Let me guess; It has a sister? A twin?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, At Borgin & Burke's. They form a passage.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Ingenius. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Malfoy, [breaking into tears] I don't want your help! Don't you understand? I have to do this! I have to kill you! Or he's gonna kill me...
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix," [walking into the astronomy tower followed by Death Eaters] Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore," Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order, don't you think?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix," Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule. [to Draco] Do it!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Greyback, He doesn't have the stomach... just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix," No! The Dark Lord was clear; The boy's to do it. This is your moment. Do it! Go on, Draco! NOW!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, No. [steps in]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dumbledore, Severus... please.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, Avada Kedavra!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Incarcerous! [Snape blocks the spell] Fight back! You coward, fight back!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Sectumsempra!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? [Harry stares in horror] Yes. I'm the Half-Blood Prince. [Kicks Harry's wand away and leaves]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall," Potter... In light of what has happened. If you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know, Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Do you think he would've done it? Draco.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. [Harry gives the locket to Hermione] It's fake. Open it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [opens the locket and reads the message] ""To the Dark Lord"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Ron's okay with it, you know. You and Ginny. If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I'm not coming back, Hermione. I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll lead me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Just do me a favor. When Im around, keep the snogging to a minimum, please."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [chuckles] Like thats going to happen. Besides, hes barking."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Funny, he says the same thing about you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Yes, but Im exceptionally perceptive."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, [chuckles] Youre brilliant. Youre both brilliant. I never realized how beautiful this place was.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[Referring to Voldemort] The longer we stay here, the stronger he gets."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"[last lines, about Dobby] I want to bury him. Properly, without magic."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,[Referring to Hermione] We won't last two days without her. [pause] Don't tell her I said that.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,[after barely managing to destroy a horcrux] Just think. Only three more to go.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,[About Xenophilius] That treacherous little bleeder! Is there no one we can trust?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"If Voldemort really has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,Actually I'm highly logical which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"Forest of Dean. I came here once with Mum and Dad. That was years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees, the river, everything. Like nothing's changed... not true of course. Everything's changed. If I brought them back here now, they'd probably not recognize any of it. Not the trees, not the river... not even me. [Pause] Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old... [Another pause] You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. I know. Gellert Grindlewald. [Hands Harry The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"[Whacking Ron with a backpack with each word after he returns] You...complete...ARSE, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after WEEKS, and you say 'Hey'?!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermoine,"[Reading the Tale of the Three Brothers] ""There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road, at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass, but being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. Before they could cross, however, they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. It was Death, and he felt cheated. Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river, but Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence, so Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby. The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave, so Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. The first brother traveled to a distant village. While with the Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him, he bragged of his invincibility. But that night, another wizard stole the wand and slit the brother's throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own. The second brother journeyed to his home, where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother. As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals."""
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"To those of you who do not know. We are joined tonight by Ms. Charity Burbage, who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle Studies. It is Ms. Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination, but something to be encouraged."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Rufus Scrimgeour," [First lines] These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," [Confronting Death Eaters on the train] Hey losers, he isn't here."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood, [to her father] Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood," [to Harry] We should close his eyes, don't you think? [closes Dobby's eyes] There. Now he could be sleeping."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Xenophilius Lovegood," [draws a line] The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. [draws a circle] The Resurrection Stone. [draws a triangle] The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of death."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred And George Weasley, [after each taking a potion to make them look like Harry] Wow! We're identical!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Severus. I was beginning to worry that you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news, I trust?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape," It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Yaxley," I heard differently, my Lord. Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the 30th of this month, the day before he turns 17."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape, This is a false trail. The Auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," What say you, Pius?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Pius," One hears many things my Lord, and if the truth is among them is not clear."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort," Ha! Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody," Potter, you're underage, which means you still have the Trace on you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What's the Trace?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody," If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is, we'll have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, The real one?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody, [brings out Polyjuice Potion] I reckon that you're familiar with this particular brew.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [recognizes it; sarcastically] No, absolutely not."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Told you he'd take it well.
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Moody," For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," Have lots of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? ...Just trying to diffuse the tension."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Shacklebolt, [pointing his wand at Lupin] The last words that Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin," ""Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him."""
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," [walking into burrow and seeing the injured George] How you feeling, Georgie?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, [quietly] Saint-like.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred, [confused pause] Come again?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George," Saint-like. I'm holy... [Points to spot where his ear is missing] Im holey, Fred. Get it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred," [laughs quietly] The whole wide world of ear-related humor, and you go for, ""I'm holy""? Thats pathetic."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, Reckon I'm still better looking than you.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin, [Holding Harry up against the wall of the burrow at wandpoint] What creature sat in the corner the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, ARE YOU MAD?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin, WHAT CREATURE!?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, A-A Grindylow!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupin, [releases Harry] We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you're not an impostor.
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Shacklebolt, What gave you away?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Hedwig, I think. She was tryna protect me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny," [while Harry zips her dress up] Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George, [after Ginny spots him and stopped kissing Harry] Morning.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," Right. Remember what we said, don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary. Just, try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing. If we do that then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside. Then..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, It gets really tricky.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Correct.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, This is completely mental.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Completely.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," The world's mental. Come on, we've got a Horcrux to find."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [as Cattermole] Morning.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [as Runcorn] Ron, it's me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [as Cattermole] Harry! Blimey, forgot what you look like. Where's Hermione?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [as Runcorn] She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [as Cattermole] Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [as Runcorn] Ron, you don't have a wife."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [as Cattermole] Oh, right."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Yaxley, Cattermole. It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, [as Cattermole] Have you tried an umbrella?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge, Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Mary, Yes?
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. [holds up said wand] Is this that wand? [She nods] Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Mary," I didn't take it! I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivanders, when I was 11. It chose me!"
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," You're lying. Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Mary," But I am! [To Ron, as Reg] Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am! [Ron is silent] Reg, tell them what I am."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Umbridge," What on earth are you doing, Albert?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," [as Runcorn] You're lying, Dolores... [Umbridge looks shocked, and Hermione tenses up] And one mustn't tell lies. Stupefy!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, There's just one problem.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," The sword was stolen. [Walks up, turns the lamp back on with his Deluminator. Ron has a stony look on his face. The locket/horcrux around his neck is affecting him greatly] Yeah. I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil your fun."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, What's wrong?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Well, nothing's wrong. Not according to you, anyway."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful just because now there's another damn thing we've gotta find."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, I thought you knew what you signed up for!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," Yeah. I thought I did, too."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we were gonna be staying in a five-star hotel? Finding a Horcrux every other day? You thought you'd be back with your mum by Christmas?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, I just thought after all this time we would have actually achieved something! I thought you knew what you were doing! I thought Dumbledore would've told you something worthwhile! I thought you had a plan!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," I told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a Horcrux already."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [bitterly] Yeah and we're about as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [trying to intervene] Ron, please. [She tries to take the locket off of Ron, but he angrily shoves her away] Please take the Horcrux off! You won't be saying any of this if you hadn't been wearing it all day!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," You don't know why I listen to that radio every night, do you? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," What, you think I'm not listening too? YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS FEELS?!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," NO, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS! Your parents are dead! You have no family!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Stop! Stop! [pulls the boys apart]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," FINE THEN, GO!!! GO THEN!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, Ron...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron M, [turns to Hermione] And you? Are you coming or are you staying? [Hermione looks torn; she glances from Harry to Ron in shock] Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," [tears in her eyes] Ron, that's; that's nothing!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, [upon arriving at Godric's Hollow] We should have taken Polyjuice potion.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, No... this is where I was born. Im not returning as someone else.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry, How did you find us?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," [takes out the deluminator] With this. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning, I was sleeping in this little pub, keeping away from some Snatchers, and I heard it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," ""It""?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," A voice. Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of it."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," And what exactly did I say, may I ask?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. And sure enough, it floated towards me, the ball of light, right through my chest and straight through me. Right here. [he touches his heart] And I knew it was going to take me where I needed to go."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron, How long do you think she'll stay mad at me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron," It was true, every word. This is gonna sound crazy, but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator. I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry," You're not still mad at him, are you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione, I'm always mad at him.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood," [takes his hand] Whenever you're ready, Sir."
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dobby The House Elf," ""Sir""? I like her very much."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, How dare you defy your master!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dobby The House Elf," Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, You stupid elf! You could have killed me!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Dobby The House Elf," Dobby never meant to kill! Dobby only meant to maim, or seriously injure!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,[About Griphook] That little git. Least we've still got Bogrod. [Bogrod gets incinerated by the dragon] That's unfortunate.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"That's my girlfriend, you numpties!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron,"[about saving Malfoy] If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna KILL YOU!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"[to Nagini, speaking in Parseltongue] The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. It makes us vulnerable. We must deploy all our forces now to find him. And you, my friend, must stay close."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,[watching as Hogwarts is protected by spells] They never learn. Pity.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"[to all of Hogwarts] I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think that to fight is wise. But this is folly. Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have one hour."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"[to all of Hogwarts] You have fought valiantly, but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you. On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you, rather than face me yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest, and confront your fate. If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,"Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived... come to die. [pause] Avada Kedavra!"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Voldemort,[last words] I killed Snape.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Snape,"[last words, as Harry collects his tears] Take them to the Pensieve. Look at me. You have your mother's eyes. [dies]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,"[to the statues] Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries, protect us! Do your duty to our school!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Mcgonagall,[After using the spell Piertotum Locomotor to bring the statues to life and fight; excited] I've always wanted to use that spell!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lily Potter," Harry, you are so loved, so loved. [Whispering] Harry, Mama loves you. Dada loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Molly Weasley," [in anger towards Bellatrix] NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Ollivander," He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true what you say and he (Voldemort) has found the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," I suppose I'll have to kill him before he finds me, then."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," [disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange, addressing a Death Eater] Good morning!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Griphook ," ""Good morning?"" ""Good morning?"" You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewey-eyed schoolgirl!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, Oi! Easy!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione," No, he's right. I was being stupid."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," He knows. You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts, he knows what we took, and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, How is it you know?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, I saw him.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," You let him in? Harry, you can't do that!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Hermione, I can't always help it! Well, maybe I can, I don't know."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, Never mind; what happened?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Well, he's angry, and he's scared too. He knows if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, What? You saw it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. They must have something to do with her. We have to go there, now."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," What? We can't do that! We've got to plan, we've got to figure it out..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, He's right. One problem. Snape's headmaster now; we can't just walk in through the front door.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade, to Honeyduke's. Take the secret passage in the cellar. It's... There's something wrong with him. It's like, you know, in the past, I've always been able to follow his thoughts. And now, everything just feels disconnected."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, Maybe it's the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker; maybe he's dying.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," No. No, it's...it's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore," Bloody fools, what were you thinking coming here? Have you any idea of how dangerous it is?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Youre Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. It's you that I've been seeing in here. You're the one who sent Dobby."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore, Where have you left him?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, He's dead.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore, Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Who gave that to you? The mirror?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore, Mundungus Fletcher. About a year ago.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Dung had no right sending it to you. It belongs to...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore," Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out that I had it, but ask yourself"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, Do you hear from the others much? From the Order?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore, The Order's finished. You-Know-Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight. Dumbledore gave us a job to do."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore, Did he now? Nice job? Easy?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's inside the castle, but we'll need your help in getting in."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore," It's not a job my brother's given you. It's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor, boy, and go home. Live a little longer."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore," What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers? [referring to the portrait of Ariana on the wall]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Why should he...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore," ...Keep secrets, you tell me?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, I trusted him.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore," That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell you where to start. You're lying! Not just to me, it doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does. You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter. So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother. I don't care that you've given up. I trusted the man I knew. We need to get into the castle tonight.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Aberforth Dumbledore, [motions toward Arianas portrait] You know what to do.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny Weasley, [sees Harry] Harry!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Hi there.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley," Six months she hasn't see me, it's like I'm a Frankie First Year. I'm only her brother..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan," She's got lots of those, though. Theres only one Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley," Shut up, Seamus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," [to Ginny] What is it, Ginny?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny Weasley, Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," Right then, so what's the plan, Harry?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," Right, what is it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, We don't know.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Dean Thomas, Where is it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, We don't know that either. I realize that's not much to go on.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan, That's nothin to go on.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Professor Snape," [to Hogwarts students] Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour. It's come to my attention that earlier this evening, Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished, in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events... who fails to come forward, will be treated... as... equally guilty. If anyone here knows any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward... now."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," [coldly] It seems despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster. [Order of Phoenix members enter] And I'm afraid it's quite extensive. How dare you stand where he stood. Tell them how it happened that night! How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him! Tell them!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall, Coward!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Pansy Parkinson, [after a long silence] What are you waiting for? Someone grab him!
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Argus Filch, [running in with Mrs. Norris; yelling] Students out of bed! STUDENTS OUT OF BED! Students in the corridor!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," [snapping] They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Argus Filch," Oh. Sorry, ma'am."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," As it happens, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I would like you, please, to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall! [motions with her wand]"
Wiki,No Entry,Movie_Argus Filch," Exactly where is it I'll be leading em to, ma'am?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall, The dungeons would do.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Time, Professor. As much as you can get me."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," Do what you have to do. Ill secure the castle. [as Harry turns to leave] And Potter, its good to see you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Its good to see you, too, Professor. [leaves]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, [to Neville]
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," Let me get this straight, Professor. [grabs her arm] You're actually giving us permission to do this?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," That is correct, Longbottom."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom, To blow it up? Boom?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall, BOOM!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom, [laughing] Wicked. But how on earth are we gonna do that?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan, [nodding] I can bring it down.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall, That's the spirit. Off you go.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Filius Flitwick," You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Minerva Mcgonagall," That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it. He's going to try to kill you either way."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Remus Lupin," It is the quality of ones convictions that determines success, not the number of followers."
Wiki,Hufflepuff,Movie_Kingsley Shacklebolt, Who said that?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Remus Lupin, Me.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George Weasley," You okay, Freddie?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Fred Weasley, Yeah.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_George Weasley, Me too.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood," Harry, wait, I need to talk to you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood," You won't find it where you're going, you're wasting your time."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," We'll talk later, okay, Luna?"
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood, Harry!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Later!
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Luna Lovegood," [shouting] Harry Potter! You listen to me right now! [calmer] Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There's not a person alive who's seen it. It's obvious, isn't it? You have to talk to someone who's dead."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, You're the Grey Lady. The Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw, I do not answer to that name.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw, Are you a friend of Luna's?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Yes. And she thought you might be able to help me.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw, You seek my mother's diadem.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Yes. That's right.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw," Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others. But she was wrong. I cannot help you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Wait! Please! I want to destroy it. [pause] That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw, Another swore to destroy it many years ago... a strange boy with a strange name.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Tom Riddle.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw, But he lied.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, He's lied to many people.
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw, I know what he's done! I know who he is! HE DEFILED IT WITH DARK MAGIC!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You do know where he hid it, don't you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please."
Wiki,Ravenclaw,Movie_Helena Ravenclaw," Strange. You remind me of him a bit. It's here, in the castle, in the place where everything is hidden. If you have to ask, you will never know. If you know, you need only ask."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Thank you.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," [points his wand at Harry] Well, well. What brings you here, Potter?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Might ask you the same.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy, You have something of mine. I'd like it back.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," [Nudging to his wand] Well, what's wrong with the one you have?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Draco Malfoy," It's my mother's, it's powerful but it's... not the same. It doesn't quite... understand. You know what I mean?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix? You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Gregory Goyle," C'mon Draco, don't be a prat, do it."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy," My Lord, might it be less... Might it not be more prudent to call off this attack? Simply seek the boy yourself?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," I do not need to seek the boy. Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand?! [slaps his face] Look at me! How can you live with yourself, Lucius?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, I... I don't know.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort, Go and find Severus. Bring him to me.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord, in the last few hours alone."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," No. No, I am extraordinary, but the wand... resists me."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," There is no wand more powerful, Ollivander himself has said. Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you, I am sure of it. It answers to you, and you only."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort, Does it?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape, My Lord...
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," The wand, does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Surely, you must know. Where does its true loyalty lie?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," With you, of course, my Lord."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine. You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus, but only I can live...forever."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape, My Lord... [Voldemort slashes with his wand and cuts Snape's throat; blood spills; Severus falls onto the window]
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," Nagini, kill. [Nagini repeatedly bites Snape, mortally wounding him]"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," It will contain the curse to your hand for the time being. It will spread, Albus."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, How long?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape, Maybe a year.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Don't ignore me, Severus. We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, one should presume that the Dark Lord would turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely. [We see Dumbledore being killed by Snape, as shown in Half-Blood Prince] There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something, but you must wait until Lord Voldemort is at his most vulnerable."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape, Must be told what?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing that it could find"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," So, when the time comes...the boy must die?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Yes, yes, he must die."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape, You've kept him alive so he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy. [Snape casts a deer Patronus, the same one that helped Harry find the Sword of Gryffindor in Part 1] Lily? [A crying Snape is shown holding Lily's body] After all this time?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Severus Snape," Always. So, when the time comes...the boy must die?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Yes, he must die. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," [Walking into a clearing in the Forest, Harry pulls the Snitch from his pocket] I'm ready to die. [He kisses it, and it opens to reveal a small black stone] The Resurrection Stone..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lily Potter," You've been so brave, sweetheart."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Why are you here, all of you?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lily Potter, We never left.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Does it hurt, dying?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius Black, Quicker than falling asleep.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_James Potter," You're nearly there, son."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Remus Lupin," Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, You'll stay with me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_James Potter, Until the end.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, And he won't be able to see you?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Sirius Black," No. [points to Harry's heart] We're here, you see."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Stay close to me.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Lily Potter, Always.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Harry, you wonderful boy. You brave man. Let us walk."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Professor, what is that?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Something beyond either of our help. A part of Voldemort, sent here to die."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, And exactly where are we?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Well, it looks like King's Cross Station, only cleaner, and without all the trains."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," King's Cross, is that right? This is, as they say, your party. I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate, since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," So it's true then, isn't it, Sir? A part of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Did. It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself. You were the Horcrux he never meant to make, Harry."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," I have to go back, haven't I?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Oh, that's up to you."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, I have a choice?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Oh, yes. We're in King's Cross, you say? I think if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, And where would it take me?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, [chuckles] On.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Voldemort has the Elder Wand.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, True.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, And the snake's still alive.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore, Yes.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, And I've nothing to kill it with.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," [walks back to Harry] Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry, to those who ask for it. I've always prized myself on my ability to turn a phrase. Words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it. But I would, in this case, amend my original statement to this"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Professor, my mother's Patronus was a doe, wasn't it? It's the same as Professor Snape's. It's curious, don't you think?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Actually, if I think about it, it doesn't seem curious at all. I'll be going now, Harry. [turns to leave]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Professor? Is this all real? Or is it just happening inside my head?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Albus Dumbledore," Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean that it's not real? [he fades into the light]"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Professor, what shall I do? Professor?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, The boy... is he dead?
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Narcissa Malfoy," [Leaning into Harry, her eyes widen as she feels his heart still beating] Is he alive? Draco, is he alive?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Narcissa Malfoy," [after Harry nods, she stands and faces Voldemort] Dead."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny Weasley," Who is that Hagrid's carrying? Neville, who is it?"
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter... is dead!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ginny Weasley, No! NO!!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," Silence! [fires a spell towards Ginny, causing her to back down] Stupid girl. Harry Potter is dead. [to Hogwarts' assembled] From this day forth, you put your faith... in me. [to Death Eaters] Harry Potter is dead! [He and his Death Eaters laugh] And now is the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us... or die."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lucius Malfoy, Draco! Draco.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Narcissa Malfoy," Draco, come."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," Well done, Draco. Well done. [Draco walks to his parents. Neville comes forward] Well, I must say, I hoped for better. [Death Eaters laugh] And who might you be, young man?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom, Neville Longbottom. [Death Eaters laugh]
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange, Ha-ha!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks--"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom, I'd like to say somethin.
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort," [makes a fist, but then lowers it] Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom, It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Seamus Finnigan," Stand down, Neville."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Neville Longbottom," People die every day. Friends, family. Yeah, we lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us, in here. [gestures to his heart] So's Fred, and Remus, Tonks... all of them. They didn't die in vain. [to Voldemort] But you will, 'cause you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us! It's not over!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Confringo!
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Bellatrix Lestrange," No! No, come back! Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," [to Ron, Hermione, and Neville] I'll lure him into the castle! We have to kill the snake."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," You were right. When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you, It will always fail you."
Wiki,Slytherin,Movie_Lord Voldemort, [last and final words] I killed Snape!
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," But what if the Wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger, Why didn't it work for him? The Elder Wand?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the Wand would become his, but the thing is, the Wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night at the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the Wand answered to him, until... the other night, when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, So that means...
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, ...It's mine.
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley, What do you reckon we should do with it?
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione Granger," ""We""?"
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Ron Weasley," I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world. With that, we'd be invincible."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Albus Severus Potter, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin, and he was the bravest man I've ever known."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter," Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful, young wizard. But, listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
Wiki,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry Potter, Really. [Train whistle blows] Ready?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,"Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,Divination's a woolly discipline.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,"Now, Ancient Runes,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,that's a fascinating subject.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,classes are you taking?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,Does he get to fly?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,just behind the wing joint.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,"Don't pull out any of his feathers,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem,because he won't thank you for that.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Bem," Oh, God."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I was going for the rat.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"Normally, I have a very sweet"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,disposition as a dog.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"More than once, James suggested"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,that I make the change permanent.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,The tail l could live with.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"But the fleas, they're murder."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"It's beautiful, isn't it?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I'll never forget the first time
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I walked through those doors.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,It'll be nice to do it again
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,as a free man.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,That was a noble thing
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,you did back there.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,He doesn't deserve it.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I didn't think my dad
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,would have wanted his best friends...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,...to become killers.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"Besides, dead,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,the truth dies with him.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"Alive, you're free."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Anything but the dementors!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,You won't let them give me...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"...to the dementors, will you?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I was your rat!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"-Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't--"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"I don't know if you know, Harry..."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"...but when you were born, James"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,and Lily made me your godfather.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I know.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I can understand if you choose
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,to stay with your aunt and uncle...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,...but if you ever wanted
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,a different home....
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,What? Come and live with you?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,It's just a thought.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I can understand if you don't want to.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Remus! Remus!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Run! Run!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Professor?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Professor Lupin?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Run!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Let's go.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I'll be forever grateful for this...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,...to both of you.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"For some time,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,my life will be too unpredictable.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,And besides...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,-...you're meant to be here.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,-But you're innocent.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,And you know it.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,"And for now, that will do."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,I expect you're tired of hearing this...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,...but you look so like your father.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,Except your eyes.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Black,-You have--

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_George,Dementors aren't supposed to be
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_George,on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_George,"After he saved you,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_George,he sent them off.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_George,There's something else

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,It may be the last thing you ever do.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"Now, who'd like to come"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,and say hello?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"Well done, Harry. Well done."

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"If he does, you can go and touch him."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hagrid,"If not-- Well,"

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"and well done, Buckbeak."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I did think of Voldemort at first.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,But then l remembered that night
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,on the train...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,-...and the dementor.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,-l'm very impressed.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,That suggests what you fear the most
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,is fear itself.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,This is very wise.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Before I fainted...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...l heard something.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,A woman...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...screaming.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Dementors force us to relive
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,our very worst memories.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Our pain becomes their power.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I think it was my mother...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...the night she was murdered.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"The very first time l saw you, Harry,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I recognized you immediately.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Not by your scar, by your eyes."

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Yes.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Oh, yes. I knew her."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Your mother was there for me
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,at a time when no one else was.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Not only was she
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,a singularly gifted witch...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...she was also
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,an uncommonly kind woman.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,She had a way of seeing
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,the beauty in others...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"...even, and most especially, when that"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,person could not see it in themselves.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"And your father, James,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,on the other hand...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...he....
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"He had a certain, shall we say,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,talent for trouble.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"A talent, rumor has it,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,he passed on to you.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,You're more like them
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"than you know, Harry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"In time, you'll come to see"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,just how much.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,We never got to go
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,to the Shrieking Shack.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,-You heard it's the most--

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,until it's been searched.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,She was a terrible singer.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No.

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,affect me so?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Dementors are the foulest creatures
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,to walk this earth.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"They feed on every good feeling,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,every happy memory...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...until a person is left with absolutely
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,nothing but his worst experiences.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"You are not weak, Harry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Dementors affect you most because
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,there are true horrors in your past.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Horrors your classmates
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,can scarcely imagine.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,You have nothing to be ashamed of.

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,-l'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I need to know how to fight them.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,You could teach me.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,You made the one

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"-l don't pretend to be an expert, Harry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,But as the dementors seem
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,to have developed an interest in you...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...perhaps I should teach you.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,But after the holidays.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"For now, I need to rest."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Come on, now!"

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,The spell l'm going to teach you

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Did you ever hear of it?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,No? Well....
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,A Patronus is a positive force.

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"...it works like a shield, with the"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,dementor feeding on it rather than him.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"But in order for it to work,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,you need to think of a memory.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Not just any memory, a very happy"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"memory, a very powerful memory."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,Can you do this?

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,It's all right. l didn't expect you
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,to do it the first time.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,That would have been remarkable.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,-That's one nasty dementor.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,#NAME?

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,A boggart.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,The real thing would be worse.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"Much, much worse."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"As a matter of interest,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,what were you thinking?

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,I saw him across the lake.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"Harry, they've captured Sirius."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,Any minute the dementors
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,are gonna perform the Kiss.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,-They're gonna kill him?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,-No. It's worse.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,Much worse.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,They're going to suck out his soul.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"Headmaster, stop them."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,-They've got the wrong man.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,-lt's true. Sirius is innocent.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,-lt's Scabbers who did it.

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,Harry!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,That was so scary.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,Poor Professor Lupin's

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"Harry, listen to me."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,No one's coming.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"Don't worry, he will."

Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,Expecto Patronum!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"You were right, Hermione."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,It was me!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,I saw myself conjuring
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,the Patronus before.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,I knew l could do it
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,this time because...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"...well, l had already done it."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,But l don't like flying...!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,Bombarda!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,"How fast is it, Harry?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," lt's a cat, Ronald."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, That's rich...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Honestly, it's not funny."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, That's awful.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Honestly, Ron. If you ask me,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Don't be silly. How could
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Just ignore him.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, No one knows.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Please, sir."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, lt's meant to be
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, He won't keep it.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Excuse me, excuse me."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Well, maybe you should"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Did not.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Didn't.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, l can't believe they're going
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Ron!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," Oh, I'm sorry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," We're in the Shrieking Shack,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Ron. You're okay.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, That looks really painful.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, l'm sure Madam Pomfrey
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone,7
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone," You foul, loathsome,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, That felt good.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Come on.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, Uh-huh.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermlone, You're dying...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Here, eat this. lt'll help."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,It's all right. lt's chocolate.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,What was that thing that came?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,It was a dementor. One of the guards
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,of Azkaban. lt's gone now.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,It was searching the train
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,for Sirius Black.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"If you'll excuse me, l need to have"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,a little word with the driver.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Eat. You'll feel better.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,What happened to me?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Well, you sort of went rigid."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,We thought maybe you were
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,having a fit or something.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,And did either of you two...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...you know...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-...pass out?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"I felt weird, though."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Like l'd never be cheerful again.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,But someone was screaming.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,A woman.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"No one was screaming, Harry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Welcome! Welcome to another year
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,at Hogwarts.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Now, l'd like to say a few words..."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...before we all become too befuddled
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,by our excellent feast.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"First, I'm pleased to welcome"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Professor R.J. Lupin...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...who's kindly consented
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,to fill the post...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...of Defense Against
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,the Dark Arts teacher.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Good luck, professor."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Of course. That's why he knew
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"to give you the chocolate, Harry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Potter. Potter. ls it true you fainted?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Magical Creatures teacher...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...has decided to retire...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...in order to spend more time
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,with his remaining limbs.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Fortunately,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I'm delighted to announce...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...that his place will be taken
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,by none other...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Intriguing, isn't it?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Would anyone like to venture
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,a guess...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...as to what is inside?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"-That's a boggart, that is."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Now, can anybody tell me"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,what a boggart looks like?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,They take the shape of whatever
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,a person fears the most.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-That's what makes them so--
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Luckily, a very simple charm exists"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,to repel a boggart.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Let's practice it now.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Without wands, please."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,After me. Riddikulus!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,A little louder and very clear.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Keep your nerve. Steady.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Riddikulus!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"And next! Step up, step up!"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Wonderful, wonderful!"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Here!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Riddikulus!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Right. Sorry about that.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,That's enough for today.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Collect your books from the back.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,That's the end of the lesson.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Thank you! Sorry!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Sorry, you can have too much"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,of a good thing.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,village are a privilege.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Should your behavior reflect poorly
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,on the school...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...that privilege shall not
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,be extended again.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"No permission form signed,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,no visiting the village.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"That's the rule, Potter."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Those with permission, follow me."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Those without, stay put."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"I thought if you signed it,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,then l could--
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I can't. Only a parent
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,or a guardian can sign.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Since I am neither,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,it would be inappropriate.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"I'm sorry, Potter."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,That's my final word.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Professor, can l ask you something?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"you facing that boggart, yes?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I thought it'd be obvious.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I assumed it would take the shape
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,of Lord Voldemort.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Harry.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,There you are. You came.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Are you sure about this, Harry?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,This is very advanced magic...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...well beyond the Ordinary
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Wizarding Level.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Yes!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Well done, Harry. Well done!"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Eat this, it helps. lt really helps."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"And just so you know, Harry..."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...l think you'd have given your father
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,a run for his money.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,And that is saying something.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I was thinking of him.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,And Mum.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Seeing their faces.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,They were talking to me.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Just talking.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,That's the memory l chose.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I don't even know if it's real.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,But it's the best I have.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Ripped to pieces?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,What are you talking about?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-l haven't lost anything!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-Your cat killed him!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Harry, you've seen the way"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...is always lurking about.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,And Scabbers is gone.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,take better care of your pets!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Well, first off, the committee members"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,took turns...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...talking about why we were there.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I got up and did my piece.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Said how Buckbeak...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"...was a good hippogriff,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,always cleaned his feathers.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Well, you can imagine."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,He said Buckbeak was a deadly
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,and dangerous creature...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...who would kill you
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,as soon as look at you.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Come in.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I haven't the faintest idea how this map
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,came to be in your possession...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"...but quite frankly, l am astounded"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,that you didn't hand it in.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Did it never occur to you that this,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,in the hands of Sirius Black...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...is a map to you?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Your father never set much store
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,by the rules either.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,But he and your mother
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,gave their lives to save yours.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Gambling their sacrifice
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,by wandering the castle unprotected...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,...with a killer on the loose
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Now, l will not cover up for you again."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I want you to return to your dormitory
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,and stay there.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,And don't take any detours.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"If you do, I shall know."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I don't think that map always works.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Someone l know to be dead.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Oh, really? And who might that be?"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Peter Pettigrew.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,That's not possible.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,It's just what l saw.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Good night, professor."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,You must look beyond.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,The art of crystal gazing
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Very well. Kill him.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,But wait one more minute.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Harry has the right to know why.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Severus--
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I told Dumbledore you were helping a
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Brilliant, Snape."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,You've put your keen mind to the task
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,and come to the wrong conclusion.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"If you'll excuse us,"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Remus and l have business...
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-...to attend to.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-Give me a reason. I beg you!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-Don't be a fool.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-He can't help it. It's habit.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-Be quiet yourself!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"You two, quarrelling"
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,like an old married couple.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Run along and play with
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,your chemistry set!
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"I could do it, you know."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,But why deny the dementors?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,They're so longing to see you.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Oh, yes."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,imagine what that must be like.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,It's said to be nearly unbearable
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"to witness, but l'll do my best."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Severus, please."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,After you.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"Hello, Harry."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,I saw you coming.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"I've looked worse, believe me."
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,-You've been sacked.
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,#NAME?
Prisonor_Of_Azk,Gryffindor,Movie_Lupln,"No. I resigned, actually."

Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,"where I needed to go, so I Disapparated..."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,...and came to this hillside.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,It was dark. I had no idea where I was.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,I just hoped
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Harry,that one of you would show yourself.

Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"""There were once three brothers..."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"...who were traveling along a lonely,"
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,winding road at twilight.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"In time, the brothers reached a river"
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,too treacherous to pass.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,But being learned in the magical arts...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...the three brothers simply
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,waved their wands and made a bridge.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Before they could cross, however..."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...they found their path blocked
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,by a hooded figure.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"It was Death, and he felt cheated."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Cheated because travelers would
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,normally drown in the river.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,But Death was cunning.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,He pretended to congratulate
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,the three brothers on their magic...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...and said that each had earned a prize for
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,having been clever enough to evade him.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,The oldest asked for a wand
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,more powerful than any in existence.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,So Death fashioned him one
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,from an elder tree that stood nearby.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,The second brother decided he wanted
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,to humiliate Death even further...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...and asked for the power
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,to recall loved ones from the grave.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,So Death plucked a stone from the river
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,and offered it to him.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Finally,"
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Death turned to the third brother.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,A humble man...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...he asked for something that would
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,allow him to go forth from that place...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...without being followed by Death.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,And so it was that Death reluctantly
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,The first brother traveled
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,to a distant village...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"...where, with the Elder Wand in hand..."
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...he killed a wizard
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,with whom he had once quarreled.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Drunk with the power
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,that the Elder Wand had given him...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...he bragged of his invincibility.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"But that night,"
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,another wizard stole the wand...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...and slit the brother's throat
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,for good measure.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,And so Death took the first brother
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,for his own.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,The second brother journeyed
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,to his home...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...where he took the stone
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,and turned it thrice in hand.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped"
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,to marry before her untimely death...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...appeared before him.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,"Yet, soon she turned sad and cold"
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,for she did not belong in the mortal world.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Driven mad with hopeless longing...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...the second brother killed himself
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,so as to join her.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,And so Death took the second brother.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,As for the third brother...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...Death searched for many years
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,but was never able to find him.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,Only when he attained a great age
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,did the youngest brother...
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,and give it to his son.
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,He then greeted Death as an old friend
Deathly_Hallows,Gryffindor,Movie_Hermione,and went with him gladly...
